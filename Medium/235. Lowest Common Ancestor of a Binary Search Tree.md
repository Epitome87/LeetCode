# [235. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-search-tree)

## Description

Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) node of two given nodes in the BST.

According to the [definition of LCA on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_ancestor): “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes `p` and `q` as the lowest node in `T` that has both `p` and `q` as descendants (where we allow **a node to be a descendant of itself**).”

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/14/binarysearchtree_improved.png)

**Input:** root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 8  
**Output:** 6  
**Explanation:** The LCA of nodes 2 and 8 is 6.

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/14/binarysearchtree_improved.png)

**Input:** root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 4  
**Output:** 2  
**Explanation:** The LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** root = [2,1], p = 2, q = 1  
**Output:** 2

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[2, 10^5]`.
- `-10^9 <= Node.val <= 10^9`
- All `Node.val` are **unique**.
- `p != q`
- `p` and `q` will exist in the BST.

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

Approach: Recursive

```js
const lowestCommonAncestor = (root, p, q) => {
  // Go left?
  if (p.val > root.val && q.val > root.val) return lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q);
  // Go right?
  if (p.val < root.val && q.val < root.val) return lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q);
  // Found result? Base case is complicated -- better to do at end
  else return root;
};
```

| Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
| --------------- | ---------------- |
| O(H)            | O(H)             |

Approach: Iterative

```js
const lowestCommonAncestor = (root, p, q) => {
  // If we have to find p in one direction of the tree and q in the OTHER,
  // the node where this split occurred must be the LCA
  // If we do not find a split, we continue until we do
  // If one of the targets is equal to the node, this node must be the LCA
  let current = root;

  while (current) {
    if (p.val > current.val && q.val > current.val) {
      current = current.right;
    } else if (p.val < current.val && q.val < current.val) {
      current = current.left;
    } /* Split occurred */ else {
      return current;
    }
  }
};
```
