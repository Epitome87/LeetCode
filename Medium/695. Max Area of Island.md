# [695. Max Area of Island](https://leetcode.com/problems/max-area-of-island)

## Description

You are given an `m x n` binary matrix grid. An island is a group of `1`'s (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical.) You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

The **area** of an island is the number of cells with a value `1` in the island.

Return _the maximum **area** of an island in_ `grid`. If there is no island, return `0`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: grid = [[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],[0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]]
Output: 6
Explanation: The answer is not 11, because the island must be connected 4-directionally.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: grid = [[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]
Output: 0
```

**Constraints:**

- m == grid.length
- n == grid[i].length
- 1 <= m, n <= 50
- grid[i][j] is either 0 or 1.

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
const maxAreaOfIsland = function (grid) {
  let max = 0;

  for (let r = 0; r < grid.length; r++) {
    for (let c = 0; c < grid[r].length; c++) {
      if (grid[r][c] === 1) {
        // Determine the area of the island this cell belongs to
        const area = explore(grid, r, c);

        // And update our result if this was a new max area
        max = Math.max(max, area);
      }
    }
  }

  return max;
};

const explore = function (grid, r, c) {
  // Return early if we aren't in bounds or aren't an UNEXPLORED land
  if (r < 0 || r >= grid.length || c < 0 || c >= grid[r].length || grid[r][c] === 0) return 0;

  // Mark as water (quick and dirty way of saying we've explored this)
  grid[r][c] = 0;

  // The area of this island is 1 (for this cell itself) + the area
  // of all valid adjacent cells.
  let area = 1;

  area += explore(grid, r - 1, c);
  area += explore(grid, r + 1, c);
  area += explore(grid, r, c - 1);
  area += explore(grid, r, c + 1);

  return area;
};
```
