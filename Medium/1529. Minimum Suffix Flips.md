# [1529. Minimum Suffix Flips](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-suffix-flips)

## Description

You are given a **0-indexed** binary string `target` of length `n`. You have another binary string `s` of length `n` that is initially set to all zeros. You want to make `s` equal to `target`.

In one operation, you can pick an index `i` where `0 <= i < n` and flip all bits in the **inclusive** range `[i, n - 1]`. Flip means changing `'0'` to `'1'` and `'1'` to `'0'`.

Return _the minimum number of operations needed to make_ `s` _equal to_ `target`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** target = "10111"  
**Output:** 3  
**Explanation:** Initially, s = "00000".  
Choose index i = 2: "00000" -> "00111"  
Choose index i = 0: "00111" -> "11000"  
Choose index i = 1: "11000" -> "10111"  
We need at least 3 flip operations to form target.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** target = "101"  
**Output:** 3  
**Explanation:** Initially, s = "000".  
Choose index i = 0: "000" -> "111"  
Choose index i = 1: "111" -> "100"  
Choose index i = 2: "100" -> "101"  
We need at least 3 flip operations to form target.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** target = "00000"  
**Output:** 0  
**Explanation:** We do not need any operations since the initial s already equals target.

**Constraints:**

- `n == target.length`
- `1 <= n <= 10^5`
- `target[i]` is either `'0'` or `'1'`.

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
/* Approach: Because we are flipping from left-to-right, we do not need
 to change the status of every flipped light i from i to n - 1. This is because
 all the lights to the right of the current one we are examining will have the same status
 -- either '0' or '1'. So we just keep track of the current status and make changes when the
 light being examined differs. */
const minFlips = (target) => {
  let result = target[0] == '1';

  for (let i = 1; i < target.length; ++i) {
    result += target[i] != target[i - 1];
  }

  return result;
};
```

```js
const minFlips = (target) => {
  let result = 0;
  let state = 0;

  for (let bit of target) {
    if (bit != state) {
      state = !state;
      ++result;
    }
  }

  return result;
};

```js
// Approach: Brute-Force by simulating the process (TLE!)
const minFlips = (target) => {
  let result = 0;
  const binaryArr = new Array(target.length).fill(0);

  for (let i = 0; i < target.length; ++i) {
    if (target[i] != binaryArr[i]) {
      ++result;
      for (let j = i; j < binaryArr.length; ++j) {
        binaryArr[j] = !binaryArr[j];
      }
    }
  }

  return result;
};
