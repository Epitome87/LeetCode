# [1769. Minimum Number of Operations to Move All Balls to Each Box](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-operations-to-move-all-balls-to-each-box)

## Description

You have `n` boxes. You are given a binary string `boxes` of length `n`, where `boxes[i]` is `'0'` if the `ith` box is **empty**, and `'1'` if it contains **one** ball.

In one operation, you can move **one** ball from a box to an adjacent box. Box `i` is adjacent to box `j` if `abs(i - j) == 1`. Note that after doing so, there may be more than one ball in some boxes.

Return an array `answer` of size `n`, where `answer[i]` is the **minimum** number of operations needed to move all the balls to the `ith` box.

Each `answer[i]` is calculated considering the **initial** state of the boxes.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** boxes = "110"  
**Output:** \[1,1,3\]  
**Explanation:** The answer for each box is as follows:

1. First box: you will have to move one ball from the second box to the first box in one operation.
2. Second box: you will have to move one ball from the first box to the second box in one operation.
3. Third box: you will have to move one ball from the first box to the third box in two operations, and move one ball from the second box to the third box in one operation.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** boxes = "001011"  
**Output:** \[11,8,5,4,3,4\]

**Constraints:**

- `n == boxes.length`
- `1 <= n <= 2000`
- `boxes[i]` is either `'0'` or `'1'`.

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
/*
Approach: Simulate moving balls first from left to right. When we encounter a box
with a ball, we add that to 'count'. We then add 'count' to 'ops' -- which serves as an
accumulation of all the balls moved up until that point. This is basically simulating moving each
ball in tandem one box to the right all at once. When we first have one ball, it requires one operation to move.
If it is moved to a box with a ball in it, the amount of operations to move all those balls to the next box increases
by one. If there is a ball in the box we just moved those two balls to, we now require 3 operations to simulating moving
each ball out of that box and into the next one, and so on and so far.

Because this only accounts for balls moved from left-to-right, we do the same process for right-to-left balls, iterating
from the end of the boxes array until the start of it. The result at index is is the summation of these two calculations.
*/
const minOperations = (boxes) => {
  const result = new Array(boxes.length).fill(0);

  // Move balls from left-to-right, bringing them all together in each new box
  for (let i = 0, numBalls = 0, numOperations = 0; i < boxes.length; ++i) {
    // Update results[i] first, as results[i] represents the operations required to move balls from 0 to i - 1
    result[i] += numOperations;

    // Increase the number of balls by 1 if the current box contains one
    numBalls += boxes[i] === '1';

    // Increase our number of operations by the amount of balls now within this box
    numOperations += numBalls;
  }

  // Move balls from right-to-left, bringing them all together in each new box
  for (let i = boxes.length - 1, numBalls = 0, numOperations = 0; i >= 0; --i) {
    result[i] += numOperations;
    numBalls += boxes[i] === '1';
    numOperations += numBalls;
  }

  return result;
};
```

```js
/* Intuition: For each i, check every other index, j.
If boxes[j] has a ball, calculate how far away from i it is.
This represents how many moves are required to move it to box i.
The sum of all such moves is result[i].
*/
const minOperations = (boxes) => {
  const result = Array(boxes.length).fill(0);

  for (let i = 0; i < boxes.length; ++i) {
    for (let j = 0; j < boxes.length; ++j) {
      if (j !== i && boxes[j] === '1') result[i] += Math.abs(j - i);
    }
  }

  return result;
};
