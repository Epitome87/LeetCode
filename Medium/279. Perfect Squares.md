# [279. Perfect Squares](https://leetcode.com/problems/perfect-squares)

## Description

Given an integer `n`, return _the least number of perfect square numbers that sum to_ `n`.

A **perfect square** is an integer that is the square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself. For example, `1`, `4`, `9`, and `16` are perfect squares while `3` and `11` are not.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 12  
**Output:** 3  
**Explanation:** 12 = 4 + 4 + 4.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 13  
**Output:** 2  
**Explanation:** 13 = 4 + 9.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 10^4`

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
/*
Approach: Math! Based on Lagrange's Four Square Theorem, there are
only 4 possible results: 1, 2, 3 and 4.
*/
const numSquares = (n) => {
  const isSquare = (n) => {
    return Math.sqrt(n) % 1 === 0;
    // const sqrt = Math.floor(Math.sqrt(n));
    // return sqrt * sqrt === n;
  };

  // If n is a perfect square, we only require 1 num (itself) to sum to n
  if (isSquare(n)) return 1;

  // The result is 4 if and only if n can be written in the form
  // 4^k * (8 * m + 7). This can be shown in Legendre's Three-Square Theorem.
  while ((n & 3) === 0) n >>= 2;
  if ((n & 7) === 7) return 4; // n % 8 === 7

  // Check whether 2 is the result
  const sqrtN = Math.sqrt(n);
  for (let i = 1; i <= sqrtN; ++i) {
    if (isSquare(n - i * i)) return 2;
  }

  // 1, 2, and 4 were not the result -- it must be 3.
  return 3;
};
```

```js
const numSquares = (n) => {
  const dp = new Array(n + 1).fill(Infinity);
  dp[0] = 0;

  for (let i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
    for (let j = 1; j * j <= i; ++j) {
      dp[i] = Math.min(dp[i], dp[i - j * j] + 1);
    }
  }

  return dp[n];
};
```

```js
/*
1st iteration: Update every dp[i] to represent the minimum number of perfect squares needed
to sum up to it based on the new square (count * count) this iteration. Update count and repeat
this process for every square [1, n].
Example: After the first iteration, 8 will require 8 squares to construct (since we have only used the square
of 1 as a candidate). On the second iteration, count is now 2, meaning the square in question (count * count) is 4.
We update every dp[i] to represent the minimum square sums that utilize either a 1 or now a 4. Going back to our 
example of 8, we now require only 2 squares to sum up to 8 (using 4 twice).

const numSquares = (n) => {
  const dp = new Array(n + 1).fill(Infinity);
  dp[0] = 0;
  let count = 1;

  while (count * count <= n) {
    const square = count * count;

    for (let i = square; i < n + 1; ++i) {
      dp[i] = Math.min(dp[i], dp[i - square] + 1);
    }

    ++count;
  }

  return dp[n];
};
