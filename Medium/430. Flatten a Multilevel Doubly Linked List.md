# [430. Flatten a Multilevel Doubly Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/flatten-a-multilevel-doubly-linked-list)

## Description

You are given a doubly linked list, which contains nodes that have a next pointer, a previous pointer, and an additional **child pointer**. This child pointer may or may not point to a separate doubly linked list, also containing these special nodes. These child lists may have one or more children of their own, and so on, to produce a **multilevel data structure** as shown in the example below.

Given the `head` of the first level of the list, **flatten** the list so that all the nodes appear in a single-level, doubly linked list. Let `curr` be a node with a child list. The nodes in the child list should appear **after** `curr` and **before** `curr.next` in the flattened list.

Return _the_ `head` _of the flattened list. The nodes in the list must have **all** of their child pointers set to_ `null`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** head = \[1,2,3,4,5,6,null,null,null,7,8,9,10,null,null,11,12\]  
**Output:** \[1,2,3,7,8,11,12,9,10,4,5,6\]

**Input:** head = \[1,2,null,3\]  
**Output:** \[1,3,2\]  
**Explanation:** The multilevel linked list in the input is shown.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** head = \[\]  
**Output:** \[\]  
**Explanation:** There could be empty list in the input.

**Constraints:**

- The number of Nodes will not exceed `1000`.
- `1 <= Node.val <= 105`

**How the multilevel linked list is represented in test cases:**

We use the multilevel linked list from **Example 1** above:

```
 1---2---3---4---5---6--NULL
         |
         7---8---9---10--NULL
             |
             11--12--NULL
```

The serialization of each level is as follows:

\[1,2,3,4,5,6,null\]
\[7,8,9,10,null\]
\[11,12,null\]

To serialize all levels together, we will add nulls in each level to signify no node connects to the upper node of the previous level. The serialization becomes:

```
\[1,    2,    3, 4, 5, 6, null\]
             |
\[null, null, 7,    8, 9, 10, null\]
                   |
\[            null, 11, 12, null\]
```

Merging the serialization of each level and removing trailing nulls we obtain:

\[1,2,3,4,5,6,null,null,null,7,8,9,10,null,null,11,12\]

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
/**
 * // Definition for a _Node.
 * function _Node(val,prev,next,child) {
 *    this.val = val;
 *    this.prev = prev;
 *    this.next = next;
 *    this.child = child;
 * };
 */

/**
 * @param {_Node} head
 * @return {_Node}
 */
const flatten = (head) => {
  /*
    When we encounter a node with a child...
    1. Mark that node
        1a. That node's child property becomes null
        1b. That node's next property points to its child
        1c. Mark this node's next pointer -- it becomes the tail of its child's list's next pointer
    2. Mark its child
        2a. That child's previous becomes the node above
        2b. The tail node of the child list should have its next pointing to
            the node in step 1's original next node.
    3. The node ORIGINALLY after the current node should now have it's previous set to the child's tail
    */
  let current = head;

  while (current) {
    // Is there a child?
    if (current.child) {
      let tail = current.child;

      // Traverse the child's nexts until it has none left
      while (tail.next) {
        tail = tail.next;
      }

      // At this point we now point at the tail.
      // We need the tail to connect to the node after our current
      tail.next = current.next;

      // Does the original start node even have a next?
      if (tail.next) {
        // If so, the tail's next (the node after original start now) now has a previous of the tail itself
        tail.next.prev = tail;
      }

      // Our node's next node is now its child
      current.next = current.child;

      // And that node's previous is ourself
      current.next.prev = current;

      // Mark the child as null
      current.child = null;
    } else {
      // Simple traversal to next node
      current = current.next;
    }
  }

  return head;
};
```
