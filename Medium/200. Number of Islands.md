# [200. Number of Islands](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands)

## Description

Given an `m x n` 2D binary grid `grid` which represents a map of `'1'`s (land) and `'0'`s (water), return _the number of islands_.

An **island** is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
]
Output: 1
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]
]
Output: 3
```

**Constraints:**

- m == grid.length
- n == grid[i].length
- 1 <= m, n <= 300
- grid[i][j] is '0' or '1'.

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
var numIslands = function (grid) {
  let islandCount = 0;

  // Visit each cell in the grid
  for (let r = 0; r < grid.length; r++) {
    for (let c = 0; c < grid[0].length; c++) {
      // If our cell exploration leads to a unique / new island
      // increment our island count
      if (exploreUnique(grid, r, c)) {
        islandCount++;
      }
    }
  }

  return islandCount;
};

const exploreUnique = (grid, r, c) => {
  // Is this cell in bounds, land (not water), and unexplored?
  if (!isExplorable(grid, r, c)) return false;

  // Mark as explored
  grid[r][c] = '2';

  // Before we return true, explore adjacent cells
  exploreUnique(grid, r - 1, c);
  exploreUnique(grid, r + 1, c);
  exploreUnique(grid, r, c - 1);
  exploreUnique(grid, r, c + 1);

  // Remember, this cell had not been explored yet, so
  // return true -- indicating it is unique.
  return true;
};

const isExplorable = (grid, r, c) => {
  // Out of bounds?
  if (r < 0 || r >= grid.length || c < 0 || c >= grid[0].length) return false;

  // Is this cell UNEXPLORED land (i.e not water, not explored land)?
  if (grid[r][c] !== '1') return false;

  return true;
};
```
