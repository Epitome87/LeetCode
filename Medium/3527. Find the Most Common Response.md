# [3527. Find the Most Common Response](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-most-common-response)

## Description

You are given a 2D string array `responses` where each `responses[i]` is an array of strings representing survey responses from the `ith` day.

Return the **most common** response across all days after removing **duplicate** responses within each `responses[i]`. If there is a tie, return the _lexicographically smallest_ response.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** responses = \[\["good","ok","good","ok"\],\["ok","bad","good","ok","ok"\],\["good"\],\["bad"\]\]  
**Output:** "good"  
**Explanation:**

- After removing duplicates within each list, `responses = [["good", "ok"], ["ok", "bad", "good"], ["good"], ["bad"]]`.
- `"good"` appears 3 times, `"ok"` appears 2 times, and `"bad"` appears 2 times.
- Return `"good"` because it has the highest frequency.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** responses = \[\["good","ok","good"\],\["ok","bad"\],\["bad","notsure"\],\["great","good"\]\]  
**Output:** "bad"  
**Explanation:**

- After removing duplicates within each list we have `responses = [["good", "ok"], ["ok", "bad"], ["bad", "notsure"], ["great", "good"]]`.
- `"bad"`, `"good"`, and `"ok"` each occur 2 times.
- The output is `"bad"` because it is the lexicographically smallest amongst the words with the highest frequency.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= responses.length <= 1000`
- `1 <= responses[i].length <= 1000`
- `1 <= responses[i][j].length <= 10`
- `responses[i][j]` consists of only lowercase English letters

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
const findCommonResponse = (responses) => {
  let mostCommon = null;
  const freq = {};

  for (let response of responses) {
    // Each response is actually an array of responses from a given day
    // We wish to only count unique responses during this day -- so put them into a Set
    const responseSet = new Set();

    for (let r of response) {
      if (responseSet.has(r)) continue;
      responseSet.add(r);
      freq[r] = freq[r] + 1 || 1;
      if (freq[r] > (freq[mostCommon] || 0)) mostCommon = r;
      else if (freq[r] === freq[mostCommon] && r < mostCommon) mostCommon = r;
    }
  }
  
  return mostCommon;
};
```
