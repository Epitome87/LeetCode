# [1992. Find All Groups of Farmland](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-groups-of-farmland)

## Description

You are given a **0-indexed** `m x n` binary matrix `land` where a `0` represents a hectare of forested land and a `1` represents a hectare of farmland.

To keep the land organized, there are designated rectangular areas of hectares that consist **entirely** of farmland. These rectangular areas are called **groups**. No two groups are adjacent, meaning farmland in one group is **not** four-directionally adjacent to another farmland in a different group.

`land` can be represented by a coordinate system where the top left corner of `land` is `(0, 0)` and the bottom right corner of `land` is `(m-1, n-1)`. Find the coordinates of the top left and bottom right corner of each **group** of farmland. A **group** of farmland with a top left corner at `(r1, c1)` and a bottom right corner at `(r2, c2)` is represented by the 4-length array `[r1, c1, r2, c2].`

Return _a 2D array containing the 4-length arrays described above for each **group** of farmland in_ `land`_. If there are no groups of farmland, return an empty array. You may return the answer in **any order**_.

**Input:** land = \[\[1,0,0\],\[0,1,1\],\[0,1,1\]\]  
**Output:** \[\[0,0,0,0\],\[1,1,2,2\]\]  
**Explanation:**  
The first group has a top left corner at land\[0\]\[0\] and a bottom right corner at land\[0\]\[0\].  
The second group has a top left corner at land\[1\]\[1\] and a bottom right corner at land\[2\]\[2\].

**Input:** land = \[\[1,1\],\[1,1\]\]  
**Output:** \[\[0,0,1,1\]\]  
**Explanation:**  
The first group has a top left corner at land\[0\]\[0\] and a bottom right corner at land\[1\]\[1\].

**Input:** land = \[\[0\]\]  
**Output:** \[\]  
**Explanation:**  
There are no groups of farmland.

**Constraints:**

- `m == land.length`
- `n == land[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 300`
- `land` consists of only `0`'s and `1`'s.
- Groups of farmland are **rectangular** in shape.

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
// Approach: Flood Fill -- works because we are dealing with rectangular groups
const findFarmland = (land) => {
  const result = [];

  for (let row = 0; row < land.length; ++row) {
    for (let col = 0; col < land[row].length; ++col) {
      if (land[row][col] === 0) continue;

      // Once we have spotted land, we can begin expanding outward
      let x = row;
      let y = col;

      // Expand the row until we reach out of bounds or forested land
      for (x = row; x < land.length && land[x][col]; ++x) {
        // Expand the col until we reach out of bounds or forested land
        for (y = col; y < land[row].length && land[x][y]; ++y) {
          // Mark this spot as forested so we do not process it again in outer-most loops
          land[x][y] = 0;
        }
      }

      // This group starts at row and col (where we began expansion) and extends
      // until the last valid x and y we found.
      result.push([row, col, x - 1, y - 1]);
    }
  }

  return result;
};
```
