# [451. Sort Characters by Frequency](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-characters-by-frequency)

## Description

Given a string `s`, sort it in **decreasing order** based on the **frequency** of the characters. The **frequency** of a character is the number of times it appears in the string.

Return _the sorted string_. If there are multiple answers, return _any of them_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "tree"  
**Output:** "eert"  
**Explanation:** 'e' appears twice while 'r' and 't' both appear once.  
So 'e' must appear before both 'r' and 't'. Therefore "eetr" is also a valid answer.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "cccaaa"  
**Output:** "aaaccc"  
**Explanation:** Both 'c' and 'a' appear three times, so both "cccaaa" and "aaaccc" are valid answers.  
Note that "cacaca" is incorrect, as the same characters must be together.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s = "Aabb"  
**Output:** "bbAa"  
**Explanation:** "bbaA" is also a valid answer, but "Aabb" is incorrect.  
Note that 'A' and 'a' are treated as two different characters.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 5 * 10^5`
- `s` consists of uppercase and lowercase English letters and digits.

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
// Approach: Brute - Force;
const frequencySort = (s) => {
  const count = [...s].reduce((acc, cur) => ((acc[cur] = acc[cur] + 1 || 1), acc), {});
  return Object.entries(count)
    .sort((a, b) => b[1] - a[1])
    .map(([key, val]) => key.repeat(val))
    .join('');
};
```
