# [2125. Number of Laser Beams in a Bank](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-laser-beams-in-a-bank)

## Description

Anti-theft security devices are activated inside a bank. You are given a **0-indexed** binary string array `bank` representing the floor plan of the bank, which is an `m x n` 2D matrix. `bank[i]` represents the `ith` row, consisting of `'0'`s and `'1'`s. `'0'` means the cell is empty, while`'1'` means the cell has a security device.

There is **one** laser beam between any **two** security devices **if both** conditions are met:

- The two devices are located on two **different rows**: `r1` and `r2`, where `r1 < r2`.
- For **each** row `i` where `r1 < i < r2`, there are **no security devices** in the `ith` row.

Laser beams are independent, i.e., one beam does not interfere nor join with another.

Return _the total number of laser beams in the bank_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** bank = \["011001","000000","010100","001000"\]  
**Output:** 8  
**Explanation:** Between each of the following device pairs, there is one beam. In total, there are 8 beams:  
 \* bank\[0\]\[1\] -- bank\[2\]\[1\]  
 \* bank\[0\]\[1\] -- bank\[2\]\[3\]  
 \* bank\[0\]\[2\] -- bank\[2\]\[1\]  
 \* bank\[0\]\[2\] -- bank\[2\]\[3\]  
 \* bank\[0\]\[5\] -- bank\[2\]\[1\]  
 \* bank\[0\]\[5\] -- bank\[2\]\[3\]  
 \* bank\[2\]\[1\] -- bank\[3\]\[2\]  
 \* bank\[2\]\[3\] -- bank\[3\]\[2\]  
Note that there is no beam between any device on the 0th row with any on the 3rd row.  
This is because the 2nd row contains security devices, which breaks the second condition.

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/12/24/laser2.jpg)

**Input:** bank = \["000","111","000"\]  
**Output:** 0  
**Explanation:** There does not exist two devices located on two different rows.

**Constraints:**

- `m == bank.length`
- `n == bank[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 500`
- `bank[i][j]` is either `'0'` or `'1'`.

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
const numberOfBeams = (bank) => {
  let result = 0;
  let previous = 0;

  for (let row of bank) {
    // Count the numbmer of security lasers in this row
    const numDevices = [...row].reduce((acc, cur) => acc + (cur === '1'), 0);

    // If we have a non-0 amount of security lasers, we can connect this row's lasers
    // with those of the last row we found devices on
    if (numDevices) {
      // Each device connects on this row connects with each device in the previous non-0 row
      result += numDevices * previous;

      // Update our previous pointer to refer to this row's devices
      previous = numDevices;
    }
  }

  return result;
};
```
