# [2658. Maximum Number of Fish in a Grid](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-fish-in-a-grid)

## Description

You are given a **0-indexed** 2D matrix `grid` of size `m x n`, where `(r, c)` represents:

- A **land** cell if `grid[r][c] = 0`, or
- A **water** cell containing `grid[r][c]` fish, if `grid[r][c] > 0`.

A fisher can start at any **water** cell `(r, c)` and can do the following operations any number of times:

- Catch all the fish at cell `(r, c)`, or
- Move to any adjacent **water** cell.

Return _the **maximum** number of fish the fisher can catch if he chooses his starting cell optimally, or_ `0` if no water cell exists.

An **adjacent** cell of the cell `(r, c)`, is one of the cells `(r, c + 1)`, `(r, c - 1)`, `(r + 1, c)` or `(r - 1, c)` if it exists.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2023/03/29/example.png)

**Input:** grid = \[\[0,2,1,0\],\[4,0,0,3\],\[1,0,0,4\],\[0,3,2,0\]\]  
**Output:** 7  
**Explanation:** The fisher can start at cell `(1,3)` and collect 3 fish, then move to cell `(2,3)`Â and collect 4 fish.

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2023/03/29/example2.png)

**Input:** grid = \[\[1,0,0,0\],\[0,0,0,0\],\[0,0,0,0\],\[0,0,0,1\]\]  
**Output:** 1  
**Explanation:** The fisher can start at cells (0,0) or (3,3) and collect a single fish.

**Constraints:**

- `m == grid.length`
- `n == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 10`
- `0 <= grid[i][j] <= 10`

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
// Approach: We are basically just looking for the sum of the largest island.
// We can use an approach similar to counting the number of islands in a graph.
// This is why we can use the same visited Set for the entire problem, as cells we've
// explored using different initial starting points have already been exhausted.
const findMaxFish = (grid) => {
  let result = 0;
  const visited = new Set();

  for (let r = 0; r < grid.length; ++r) {
    for (let c = 0; c < grid[0].length; ++c) {
      if (grid[r][c]) {
        result = Math.max(result, exploreRegion(grid, r, c, visited));
      }
    }
  }

  return result;
};

// DFS which will return how many fish we can catch if starting at this row and col
const exploreRegion = (grid, r, c, visited) => {
  // Ensure we are not out of bounds, on land, or visiting a previously-explored cell
  if (r < 0 || r >= grid.length || c < 0 || c >= grid[0].length || grid[r][c] === 0 || visited.has(`${r},${c}`))
    return 0;

  visited.add(`${r},${c}`);
  let numFish = grid[r][c];
  const dirs = [
    [-1, 0],
    [1, 0],
    [0, -1],
    [0, 1],
  ];

  for (let [dr, dc] of dirs) {
    numFish += exploreRegion(grid, r + dr, c + dc, visited);
  }

  return numFish;
};
```
