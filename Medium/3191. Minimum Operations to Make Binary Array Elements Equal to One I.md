# [3191. Minimum Operations to Make Binary Array Elements Equal to One I](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-operations-to-make-binary-array-elements-equal-to-one-i)

## Description

You are given a binary array `nums`.

You can do the following operation on the array **any** number of times (possibly zero):

- Choose **any** 3 **consecutive** elements from the array and **flip** **all** of them.

**Flipping** an element means changing its value from 0 to 1, and from 1 to 0.

Return the **minimum** number of operations required to make all elements in `nums` equal to 1. If it is impossible, return -1.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[0,1,1,1,0,0\]  
**Output:** 3  
**Explanation:**  
We can do the following operations:

- Choose the elements at indices 0, 1 and 2. The resulting array is `nums = [**1**,**0**,**0**,1,0,0]`.
- Choose the elements at indices 1, 2 and 3. The resulting array is `nums = [1,**1**,**1**,**0**,0,0]`.
- Choose the elements at indices 3, 4 and 5. The resulting array is `nums = [1,1,1,**1**,**1**,**1**]`.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[0,1,1,1\]  
**Output:** \-1  
**Explanation:**  
It is impossible to make all elements equal to 1.

**Constraints:**

- `3 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 1`

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
// Approach: Brute-Force by simulating the process
// Every time we encounter a 0, flip it and the next two nums
const minOperations = (nums) => {
  let result = 0;

  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length - 2; ++i) {
    if (!nums[i]) {
      ++result;
      nums[i] = 1;
      nums[i + 1] ^= 1;
      nums[i + 2] ^= 1;
    }
  }

  // If we never ended up flipping the last two numbers to a 1, we didn't
  // arrive at a successful result.
  return nums.at(-1) === 1 && nums.at(-2) === 1 ? result : -1;
};
```
