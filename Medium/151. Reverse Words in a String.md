# [151. Reverse Words in a String](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-words-in-a-string)

## Description

Given an input string `s`, reverse the order of the **words**.

A **word** is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The **words** in `s` will be separated by at least one space.

Return _a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space._

**Note** that `s` may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "the sky is blue"  
**Output:** "blue is sky the"

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = " hello world "  
**Output:** "world hello"  
**Explanation:** Your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s = "a good example"  
**Output:** "example good a"  
**Explanation:** You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 10^4`
- `s` contains English letters (upper-case and lower-case), digits, and spaces `' '`.
- There is **at least one** word in `s`.

**Follow-up:** If the string data type is mutable in your language, can you solve it **in-place** with `O(1)` extra space?

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
/*
Approach: Two Pointers
We use built-in methods to trim the string of leading, trailer, and redundant spaces.
We then use two pointers to swap the two end characters, closing in each pointer.
*/
const reverseWords = (s) => {
  const cleanStr = s.trim().split(/\s+/);
  let start = 0;
  let end = cleanStr.length - 1;

  while (start < end) {
    const temp = cleanStr[start];
    cleanStr[start] = cleanStr[end];
    cleanStr[end] = temp;
    ++start;
    --end;
  }

  return cleanStr.join(' ');
};
```

```js
// Approach: Using a Stack, and built-in methods to clean spaces.
const reverseWords = (s) => {
  const result = [];
  const words = s.trim().split(/\s+/);
  const stack = [];

  for (let word of words) stack.push(word);
  while (stack.length) result.push(stack.pop());

  return result.join(' ');
};
```
