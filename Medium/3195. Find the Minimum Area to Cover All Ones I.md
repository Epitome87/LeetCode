# [3195. Find the Minimum Area to Cover All Ones I](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-minimum-area-to-cover-all-ones-i)

## Description

You are given a 2D **binary** array `grid`. Find a rectangle with horizontal and vertical sides with the **smallest** area, such that all the 1's in `grid` lie inside this rectangle.

Return the **minimum** possible area of the rectangle.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** grid = \[\[0,1,0\],\[1,0,1\]\]  
**Output:** 6  
**Explanation:**  
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2024/05/08/examplerect0.png)  
The smallest rectangle has a height of 2 and a width of 3, so it has an area of `2 * 3 = 6`.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** grid = \[\[1,0\],\[0,0\]\]  
**Output:** 1  
**Explanation:**  
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2024/05/08/examplerect1.png)  
The smallest rectangle has both height and width 1, so its area is `1 * 1 = 1`.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= grid.length, grid[i].length <= 1000`
- `grid[i][j]` is either 0 or 1.
- The input is generated such that there is at least one 1 in `grid`.

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
// Approach: Simply find the minimum and maximum coordinates with a value of 1. This will maximize the area.
const minimumArea = (grid) => {
  let top = grid.length; // We want to minimize top value, so we set this to its maximum
  let bottom = 0; // We want to maximize bottom value, so we set this to its minimum
  let left = grid[0].length; // We want to minimize left, so we set this to its maximum
  let right = 0; // We want to maximize right, so we set this to its minimum

  for (let row = 0; row < grid.length; ++row) {
    for (let col = 0; col < grid[0].length; ++col) {
      if (grid[row][col]) {
        top = Math.min(top, row);
        bottom = Math.max(bottom, row);
        left = Math.min(left, col);
        right = Math.max(right, col);
      }
    }
  }

  const width = right - left + 1;
  const height = bottom - top + 1;
  const area = width * height;

  return area;
};
```
