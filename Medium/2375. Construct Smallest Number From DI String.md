# [2375. Construct Smallest Number From DI String](https://leetcode.com/problems/construct-smallest-number-from-di-string)

## Description

You are given a **0-indexed** string `pattern` of length `n` consisting of the characters `'I'` meaning **increasing** and `'D'` meaning **decreasing**.

A **0-indexed** string `num` of length `n + 1` is created using the following conditions:

- `num` consists of the digits `'1'` to `'9'`, where each digit is used **at most** once.
- If `pattern[i] == 'I'`, then `num[i] < num[i + 1]`.
- If `pattern[i] == 'D'`, then `num[i] > num[i + 1]`.

Return _the lexicographically **smallest** possible string_ `num` _that meets the conditions._

**Example 1:**

**Input:** pattern = "IIIDIDDD"  
**Output:** "123549876"  
**Explanation:**  
At indices 0, 1, 2, and 4 we must have that num\[i\] < num\[i+1\].  
At indices 3, 5, 6, and 7 we must have that num\[i\] > num\[i+1\].  
Some possible values of num are "245639871", "135749862", and "123849765".  
It can be proven that "123549876" is the smallest possible num that meets the conditions.  
Note that "123414321" is not possible because the digit '1' is used more than once.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** pattern = "DDD"  
**Output:** "4321"  
**Explanation:**  
Some possible values of num are "9876", "7321", and "8742".  
It can be proven that "4321" is the smallest possible num that meets the conditions.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= pattern.length <= 8`
- `pattern` consists of only the letters `'I'` and `'D'`.

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
/*
Approach: If we meet a series of I's, we can greedily pick the next smallest number.
When we encounter a D, however, we'd have to pick the second smallest, then the smallest.
And if we meet another D after that, we'd have to actually pick the third smallest, then the second smallest,
then the smallest (like 3, 2, then 1).
Therefore, we build a stack of characters up. When we encounter an I we place the reverse of the stack into our
result array. We repeat this process for each 'I', or if we reach the end of the string.
*/
const smallestNumber = (pattern) => {
  const result = [];
  let stack = [];

  for (let i = 0; i <= pattern.length; ++i) {
    stack.push(i + 1);
    if (pattern[i] === 'I' || i === pattern.length) {
      while (stack.length) result.push(stack.pop()); // Push the reverse of the stack
    }
  }

  return result.join('');
};
```

```js
const smallestNumber = (pattern) => {
  const result = [];
  let stack = [];

  for (let i = 0; i <= pattern.length; ++i) {
    stack.push(`${i + 1}`);
    if (pattern[i] === 'I' || i === pattern.length) {
      result.push(...stack.reverse());
      stack = [];
    }
  }

  return result.join('');
};
```
