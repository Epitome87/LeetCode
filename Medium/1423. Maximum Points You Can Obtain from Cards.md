# [1423. Maximum Points You Can Obtain from Cards](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-points-you-can-obtain-from-cards)

## Description

There are several cards **arranged in a row**, and each card has an associated number of points. The points are given in the integer array `cardPoints`.

In one step, you can take one card from the beginning or from the end of the row. You have to take exactly `k` cards.

Your score is the sum of the points of the cards you have taken.

Given the integer array `cardPoints` and the integer `k`, return the _maximum score_ you can obtain.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** cardPoints = \[1,2,3,4,5,6,1\], k = 3  
**Output:** 12  
**Explanation:** After the first step, your score will always be 1. However, choosing the rightmost card first will maximize your total score. The optimal strategy is to take the three cards on the right, giving a final score of 1 + 6 + 5 = 12.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** cardPoints = \[2,2,2\], k = 2  
**Output:** 4  
**Explanation:** Regardless of which two cards you take, your score will always be 4.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** cardPoints = \[9,7,7,9,7,7,9\], k = 7  
**Output:** 55  
**Explanation:** You have to take all the cards. Your score is the sum of points of all cards.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= cardPoints.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= cardPoints[i] <= 10^4`
- `1 <= k <= cardPoints.length`

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
/*
Approach: Classic 'smallest subarray sum'
Rather than dealing with the awkward nature of this problem, where cards 
can be chosen from one of two ends one at a time, take note of the cards that 
ARE NOT being chosen. They form a contiguous series of vales -- a subarray!
So rather than finding left and right cards with the highest sum, find the unchosen
cards with the LOWEST sum -- as this means the remaining cards must have the highest sum.
*/
const maxScore = (cardPoints, k) => {
  const totalPoints = cardPoints.reduce((acc, cur) => acc + cur, 0);
  const windowSize = cardPoints.length - k;
  let minSubarraySum = Infinity;
  let start = 0;
  let end = 0;
  let curSum = 0;

  while (end < cardPoints.length) {
    // Introduce the value of the right-most card to our sum
    curSum += cardPoints[end];

    // Shrink our window while it is too large
    if (end - start + 1 > windowSize) {
      // We do this by removing the left-most card from consideration
      curSum -= cardPoints[start];
      start++;
    }

    // If we reach the required window size, update potential new minimum sum
    if (end - start + 1 === windowSize) {
      minSubarraySum = Math.min(minSubarraySum, curSum);
    }

    // Expand our window for next iteration
    end++;
  }

  return totalPoints - minSubarraySum;
};
```

```js
const maxScore = (cardPoints, k) => {
  let maxPoints = 0;

  // Sum the first k cards in the window. This represents favoring all the left-most
  // cards to begin with. Our for-loop will slowly remove left cards and add right cards
  for (let i = 0; i < k; i++) {
    maxPoints += cardPoints[i];
  }

  let curPoints = maxPoints;

  for (let i = k - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    // Remove the last visited card
    curPoints -= cardPoints[i];

    // And add the next right-most unvisited card instead
    // This represents favoring picking the right side over the left
    curPoints += cardPoints[cardPoints.length - k + i];

    // Have we reached a new maximum card points?
    maxPoints = Math.max(maxPoints, curPoints);
  }

  return maxPoints;
};
```

**Python**

```py
def maxScore(cardPoints: List[int], k: int) -> int:
    card_sum = sum(cardPoints[:k])
    result = card_sum

    for i in range(1, k + 1):
        card_sum += cardPoints[-i]
        card_sum -= cardPoints[k - i]
        result = max(result, card_sum)

    return result
```
