# [735. Asteroid Collision](https://leetcode.com/problems/asteroid-collision)

## Description

We are given an array `asteroids` of integers representing asteroids in a row. The indices of the asteriod in the array represent their relative position in space.

For each asteroid, the absolute value represents its size, and the sign represents its direction (positive meaning right, negative meaning left). Each asteroid moves at the same speed.

Find out the state of the asteroids after all collisions. If two asteroids meet, the smaller one will explode. If both are the same size, both will explode. Two asteroids moving in the same direction will never meet.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** asteroids = \[5,10,-5\]  
**Output:** \[5,10\]  
**Explanation:** The 10 and -5 collide resulting in 10. The 5 and 10 never collide.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** asteroids = \[8,-8\]  
**Output:** \[\]  
**Explanation:** The 8 and -8 collide exploding each other.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** asteroids = \[10,2,-5\]  
**Output:** \[10\]  
**Explanation:** The 2 and -5 collide resulting in -5. The 10 and -5 collide resulting in 10.

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= asteroids.length <= 10^4`
- `-1000 <= asteroids[i] <= 1000`
- `asteroids[i] != 0`

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
/*
Only asteroids which are moving left and have an asteroid to their left will collide
So every time we encounter a positive (right-moving) asteroid, push it to a stack.
When we encounter a negative (left-moving) asteroid, it will collide with the asteroid
on the top of the stack. If the left-moving asteroid is a smaller absolute value, it gets pushed
onto the stack and the top-most asteroid is removed. If the right-moving asteroid is larger,
simply keep it on the stack and do not push the left-moving one onto the stack.
*/
const asteroidCollision = (asteroids) => {
  const stack = [];

  for (let i = 0; i < asteroids.length; ++i) {
    // We need to check the current asteroid and the previous to determine collisions
    const last = stack.at(-1);
    const cur = asteroids[i];

    // If stack is empty, or previous asteroid is moving left, or current is moving right
    if (!stack.length || last < 0 || cur > 0) {
      stack.push(cur);
    } else if (-cur === last) {
      // Current and last asteroids are same size and opposite direction; destroy both!
      stack.pop();
    } else if (-cur > last) {
      // Current asteroid is larger than last; destroy the last asteroid and move onto the next previous
      stack.pop();
      --i;
    }
  }

  return stack;
};
```

**Python**

```py
def asteroidCollision(asteroids: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    result = []

    for asteroid in asteroids:
        # We need to resolve collisions when:
        # 1. Stack is not empty
        # 2. Current asteroid is left-moving
        # 3. Top of stack is right-moving
        while len(result) and asteroid < 0 and result[-1] > 0:
            # Both asteroids are equal; destroy both
            if result[-1] == -asteroid:
                result.pop()
                break
            # Top of stack is smaller, destroy the right-moving asteroid and continue comparison
            elif result[-1] < -asteroid:
                result.pop()
                continue
            # Top of stack is larger, destroy the left-moving asteroid
            elif result[-1] > -asteroid:
                break
        # If we broke from the while loop, it means a left-moving asteroid made it
        # all the way to the bottom of the stack and destroyed all asteroids; add it
        else:
            result.append(asteroid)

    return result
```
