# [322. Coin Change](https://leetcode.com/problems/coin-change)

## Description

You are given an integer array `coins` representing coins of different denominations and an integer `amount` representing a total amount of money.

Return _the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount_. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return `-1`.

You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** coins = [1,2,5], amount = 11  
**Output:** 3  
**Explanation:** 11 = 5 + 5 + 1

**Example 2:**

**Input:** coins = [2], amount = 3  
**Output:** -1

**Example 3:**

**Input:** coins = [1], amount = 0  
**Output:** 0

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= coins.length <= 12`
- `1 <= coins[i] <= 2^31 - 1`
- `0 <= amount <= 10^4`

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
// Approach: Dynamic Programming with 1D array
const coinChange = (coins, amount) => {
  const sortedCoins = [...coins].sort((a, b) => a - b);
  const dp = new Array(amount + 1).fill(Infinity);
  dp[0] = 0;

  for (let i = 1; i <= amount; i++) {
    for (let coin of sortedCoins) {
      // Ensure current coin wouldn't put us over the amount (i) we need
      // NOTE: Now that the coins are sorted, this also means we have already
      // observed all valid coin candidates
      if (coin > i) break;

      // To reach an amount of i, we need the smaller of either dp[i] (our current best solution)
      // or 1 new coin (representing choosing this coin) plus however many coins we needed
      // to reach an amount of i - coin (which was already optimally solved)
      dp[i] = Math.min(dp[i], 1 + dp[i - coin]);
    }
  }

  return dp[amount] === Infinity ? -1 : dp[amount];
};
```

| O(Amount \* NumCoins) | O(N)             |
