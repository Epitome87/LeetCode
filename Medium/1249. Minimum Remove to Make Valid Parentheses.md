# [1249. Minimum Remove to Make Valid Parentheses](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-remove-to-make-valid-parentheses)

## Description

Given a string s of `'('` , `')'` and lowercase English characters.

Your task is to remove the minimum number of parentheses ( `'('` or `')'`, in any positions ) so that the resulting _parentheses string_ is valid and return **any** valid string.

Formally, a _parentheses string_ is valid if and only if:

- It is the empty string, contains only lowercase characters, or
- It can be written as `AB` (`A` concatenated with `B`), where `A` and `B` are valid strings, or
- It can be written as `(A)`, where `A` is a valid string.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "lee(t(c)o)de)"  
**Output:** "lee(t(c)o)de"  
**Explanation:** "lee(t(co)de)" , "lee(t(c)ode)" would also be accepted.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "a)b(c)d"  
**Output:** "ab(c)d"

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s = "))(("  
**Output:** ""  
**Explanation:** An empty string is also valid.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`
- `s[i]` is eitherÂ `'('` , `')'`, or lowercase English letter.

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
/*
Approach:
Push OPENING brackets to stack
If we encounter an extra number of CLOSING brackets than there are OPENING, we must remove those CLOSING
If by the end we have extra OPENING brackets on the stack, they must be removed
*/
const minRemoveToMakeValid = (s) => {
  const stack = [];
  const result = s.split('');

  for (let i = 0; i < result.length; i++) {
    if (result[i] === '(') {
      stack.push(i);
    } else if (s[i] === ')') {
      // Is there an unclosed opening?
      if (stack.length) {
        // Then this closing is good to stay!
        // Remove an opening to mark this is staying
        stack.pop();
      } else {
        result[i] = '';
      }
    }
  }

  // Remove opening brackets that never got closed
  while (stack.length) {
    const idx = stack.pop();
    result[idx] = '';
  }

  return result.join('');
};
```
