# [2537. Count the Number of Good Subarrays](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-the-number-of-good-subarrays)

## Description

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return _the number of **good** subarrays of_ `nums`.

A subarray `arr` is **good** if there are **at least** `k` pairs of indices `(i, j)` such that `i < j` and `arr[i] == arr[j]`.

A **subarray** is a contiguous **non-empty** sequence of elements within an array.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,1,1,1,1\], k = 10  
**Output:** 1  
**Explanation:** The only good subarray is the array nums itself.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[3,1,4,3,2,2,4\], k = 2  
**Output:** 4  
**Explanation:** There are 4 different good subarrays:

- \[3,1,4,3,2,2\] that has 2 pairs.
- \[3,1,4,3,2,2,4\] that has 3 pairs.
- \[1,4,3,2,2,4\] that has 2 pairs.
- \[4,3,2,2,4\] that has 2 pairs.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= nums[i], k <= 10^9`

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
/*
Approach: Sliding Window with hashmap
For [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] we can pair the first 1 with FOUR others
the 2nd with THREE, the 3rd with TWO, and the 4th with ONE
So for every num, the contribution for the condition i < j and arr[i] == arr[j]
is met an amount equal to the frequency of that num before its occurrence
*/
const countGood = (nums, k) => {
  let result = 0;
  let start = 0;
  let end = 0;
  let numPairs = 0;
  const freq = {};

  while (end < nums.length) {
    // Does nums[end] contribute to our aggregate (number of pairs)?
    numPairs += freq[nums[end]] || 0;

    // Increment the frequency of nums[end]
    freq[nums[end]] = freq[nums[end]] + 1 || 1;

    // Shrink our window until we do not satisfy having at least k numPairs
    while (numPairs >= k) {
      // This subarray and all AFTER it are also valid -- add them to the result
      // result += nums.length - end;

      // Remove nums[start] from the window, as well as its contribution to our aggregate (numPairs)
      freq[nums[start]]--;
      numPairs -= freq[nums[start]];
      start++;
    }

    // A more clever way to increment our result
    result += start;

    // Expand our window
    end++;
  }

  return result;
};
```
