# [19. Remove Nth Node from End of List](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-nth-node-from-end-of-list)

## Description

Given the `head` of a linked list, remove the `nth` node from the end of the list and return its head.

**Example 1:**

Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], n = 2  
Output: [1,2,3,5]

**Example 2:**

Input: head = [1], n = 1  
Output: []

**Example 3:**

Input: head = [1,2], n = 1  
Output: [1]

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the list is sz.
- 1 <= sz <= 30
- 0 <= Node.val <= 100
- 1 <= n <= sz

**Follow up:** Could you do this in one pass?

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
const removeNthFromEnd = function (head, n) {
  let slow = head;
  let fast = head;

  // Move fast n nodes ahead. Don't worry about null checks here!
  while (n-- > 0) fast = fast.next;

  // If fast is null, linked list length is equal to n. (Constraints ensure length never < n)
  // This means we should delete the first node, i.e simply return head.next
  if (!fast) return head.next;

  // At this point, we have set fast to point n nodes ahead of slow
  // Therefore, if we iterate fast and slow until fast until fast.next isn't null,
  // slow will point to the nth - 1 from last element
  // Iterating while (fast) would give us the nth node, so we want while (fast.next) here!
  while (fast.next) {
    slow = slow.next;
    fast = fast.next;
  }

  // Remove the nth node by setting the connection PRIOR to it equal to the node AFTER it
  slow.next = slow.next.next;

  return head;
};
```

```js
const removeNthFromEnd = function (head, n) {
  let slow = head;
  let fast = head;

  // Move fast n nodes ahead. Don't worry about null checks here!
  // for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
  //     fast = fast.next;
  // }

  // Or:
  while (n-- > 0) fast = fast.next;

  // If fast is null, linked list length is equal to n. (Constraints ensure length never < n)
  // This means we should delete the first node, i.e simply return head.next
  if (!fast) return head.next;

  // At this point, we have set fast to point n nodes ahead of slow
  // Therefore, if we iterate fast and slow until fast until fast.next isn't null,
  // slow will point to the nth - 1 from last element
  // Iterating while (fast) would give us the nth node, so we want while (fast.next) here!
  while (fast.next) {
    slow = slow.next;
    fast = fast.next;
  }

  // Remove the nth node by setting the connection PRIOR to it equal to the node AFTER it
  slow.next = slow.next.next;

  return head;
};
```

```js
const removeNthFromEnd = function (head, n) {
  // We need a dummy node that will point to the start of the list
  const dummy = new ListNode(0, head);

  // We need two traversal nodes
  // Slow starts at our dummy. This way, when we traverse it n times, we are actually
  // going to be pointing to the nth - 1 node -- which is our intention!
  // Fast starts at the head of our list
  let slow = dummy;
  let fast = head;

  // Traverse fast n times (or until it has no next node)
  for (let i = 0; i < n && fast; i++) {
    fast = fast.next;
  }

  // At this point, fast is n - 1 nodes ahead of slow
  // Traverse slow and fast (at equal paces) until fast is null
  while (fast) {
    slow = slow.next;
    fast = fast.next;
  }

  // Slow now points to the node BEFORE the nth node
  // Break its connection to the nth node (thereby removing it) by having its next point
  // to the nth + 1 node
  slow.next = slow.next.next;

  return dummy.next;
};
```

**Python**

```python
def removeNthFromEnd(self, head: Optional[ListNode], n: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
    result = ListNode(0, head)
    dummy = result

    for _ in range(n):
        head = head.next

    while head:
        head = head.next
        dummy = dummy.next

    dummy.next = dummy.next.next

    return result.next
```
