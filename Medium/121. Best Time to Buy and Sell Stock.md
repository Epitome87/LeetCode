# [121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock)

## Description

You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the i<sup>th</sup> day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return `0`.

**Example 1:**

Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5  
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.  
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.

**Example 2:**

Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]  
Output: 0  
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.

**Constraints:**

- 1 <= prices.length <= 10<sup>5</sup>
- 0 <= prices[i] <= 10<sup>4</sup>

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
const maxProfit = (prices) => {
  let left = 0,
    right = 1,
    bestProfit = 0;

  while (right < prices.length) {
    if (prices[left] > prices[right]) left = right;
    else bestProfit = Math.max(prices[right] - prices[left], bestProfit);
    right++;
  }

  return bestProfit;
};
```
