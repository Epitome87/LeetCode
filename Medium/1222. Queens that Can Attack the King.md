# [1222. Queens that Can Attack the King](https://leetcode.com/problems/queens-that-can-attack-the-king)

## Description

On a **0-indexed** `8 x 8` chessboard, there can be multiple black queens and one white king.

You are given a 2D integer array `queens` where `queens[i] = [xQueeni, yQueeni]` represents the position of the `ith` black queen on the chessboard. You are also given an integer array `king` of length `2` where `king = [xKing, yKing]` represents the position of the white king.

Return _the coordinates of the black queens that can directly attack the king_. You may return the answer in **any order**.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/12/21/chess1.jpg)

**Input:** queens = \[\[0,1\],\[1,0\],\[4,0\],\[0,4\],\[3,3\],\[2,4\]\], king = \[0,0\]  
**Output:** \[\[0,1\],\[1,0\],\[3,3\]\]  
**Explanation:** The diagram above shows the three queens that can directly attack the king and the three queens that cannot attack the king (i.e., marked with red dashes).

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/12/21/chess2.jpg)

**Input:** queens = \[\[0,0\],\[1,1\],\[2,2\],\[3,4\],\[3,5\],\[4,4\],\[4,5\]\], king = \[3,3\]  
**Output:** \[\[2,2\],\[3,4\],\[4,4\]\]  
**Explanation:** The diagram above shows the three queens that can directly attack the king and the three queens that cannot attack the king (i.e., marked with red dashes).

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= queens.length < 64`
- `queens[i].length == king.length == 2`
- `0 <= xQueeni, yQueeni, xKing, yKing < 8`
- All the given positions are **unique**.

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
/*
Check all 8 directions, starting with the King.
The first time we encounter a Queen in that direction, we 
add it to the results and break -- as we cannot encounter more Queens.
Note this way of quickly looping through 8 directions will check outside
of the boundaries of the board, but that's fine enough!
*/
const queensAttacktheKing = (queens, king) => {
  const result = [];
  const queenSet = new Set();

  for (let [x, y] of queens) {
    queenSet.add(`${x},${y}`);
  }

  // [-1, -1], [-1, 0], [-1, 1]       Diagonal to left/up, Left, Diagonal to left/down
  // [0, -1], [0, 0], [0, 1]          Up, Nothing, Down
  // [1, -1], [1, 0], [1, 1]          Diagonal to right/up, Right, Diagonal right/down
  for (let i of [-1, 0, 1]) {
    for (let j of [-1, 0, 1]) {
      for (let k = 1; k <= 8; ++k) {
        let x = king[0] + i * k;
        let y = king[1] + j * k;

        if (queenSet.has(`${x},${y}`)) {
          result.push([x, y]);
          break;
        }
      }
    }
  }

  return result;
};
```
