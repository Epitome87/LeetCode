# [419. Battleships in a Board](https://leetcode.com/problems/battleships-in-a-board)

## Description

Given an `m x n` matrix `board` where each cell is a battleship `'X'` or empty `'.'`, return _the number of the **battleships** on_ `board`.

**Battleships** can only be placed horizontally or vertically on `board`. In other words, they can only be made of the shape `1 x k` (`1` row, `k` columns) or `k x 1` (`k` rows, `1` column), where `k` can be of any size. At least one horizontal or vertical cell separates between two battleships (i.e., there are no adjacent battleships).

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2024/06/21/image.png)

**Input:** board = \[\["X",".",".","X"\],\[".",".",".","X"\],\[".",".",".","X"\]\]  
**Output:** 2

**Example 2:**

**Input:** board = \[\["."\]\]  
**Output:** 0

**Constraints:**

- `m == board.length`
- `n == board[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 200`
- `board[i][j]` is either `'.'` or `'X'`.

**Follow up:** Could you do it in one-pass, using only `O(1)` extra memory and without modifying the values `board`?

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
// Only count a ship as new by observing it's "first" cell, which we will
// say is the most top-left cell. If an 'X' has another 'X' to its left or above it,
// it must be part of a ship we have already counted.
const countBattleships = (board) => {
  let result = 0;

  for (let row = 0; row < board.length; ++row) {
    for (let col = 0; col < board[row].length; ++col) {
      if (board[row][col] !== 'X') continue; // Not concerned with empty cells
      if (row > 0 && board[row - 1][col] === 'X') continue; // Not a new ship
      if (col > 0 && board[row][col - 1] === 'X') continue; // Not a new ship
      ++result; // Must be a new ship if we reach this line
    }
  }

  return result;
};
```

```js
// Approach: Perform a dfs. Similar to counting the number of islands in a graph
const countBattleships = (board) => {
  let result = 0;
  const m = board.length;
  const n = board[0].length;
  const visited = new Set();

  for (let row = 0; row < m; ++row) {
    for (col = 0; col < n; ++col) {
      if (board[row][col] === 'X' && !visited.has(row + ',' + col)) {
        dfs(board, row, col, visited);
        ++result;
      }
    }
  }

  return result;
};

const dfs = (board, r, c, visited) => {
  const m = board.length;
  const n = board[0].length;

  // Ensure we're: In bounds. On an unvisited cell. On a cell that a ship is a part of.
  if (r < 0 || c < 0 || r >= m || c >= n || visited.has(r + ',' + c) || board[r][c] !== 'X') return;

  // We've now explored this cell
  visited.add(r + ',' + c);

  // Further explore all 4 directions around this cell
  const directions = [
    [0, 1],
    [0, -1],
    [-1, 0],
    [1, 0],
  ];
  for (let [deltaRow, deltaCol] of directions) {
    dfs(board, r + deltaRow, c + deltaCol, visited);
  }
};
```
