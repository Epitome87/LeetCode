# [3223. Minimum Length of String After Operations](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-length-of-string-after-operations)

## Description

You are given a string `s`.

You can perform the following process on `s` **any** number of times:

- Choose an index `i` in the string such that there is **at least** one character to the left of index `i` that is equal to `s[i]`, and **at least** one character to the right that is also equal to `s[i]`.
- Delete the **closest** occurrence of `s[i]` located to the **left** of `i`.
- Delete the **closest** occurrence of `s[i]` located to the **right** of `i`.

Return the **minimum** length of the final string `s` that you can achieve.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "abaacbcbb"  
**Output:** 5  
**Explanation:**  
We do the following operations:

- Choose index 2, then remove the characters at indices 0 and 3. The resulting string is `s = "bacbcbb"`.
- Choose index 3, then remove the characters at indices 0 and 5. The resulting string is `s = "acbcb"`.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "aa"  
**Output:** 2  
**Explanation:**  
We cannot perform any operations, so we return the length of the original string.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 2 * 10^5`
- `s` consists only of lowercase English letters.

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
const minimumLength = (s) => {
  let result = 0;
  const frequency = new Array(26).fill(0);

  for (let char of s) ++frequency[char.charCodeAt() - 97];

  for (let count of frequency) {
    // Skip characters that do not appear at all
    if (count === 0) continue;

    // Characters that appear an odd amount contribute + 1 to the result
    if (count % 2) result++;
    // Characters that appear an even amount contribute + 2 to the result
    else result += 2;
  }

  return result;
};
```

```js
const minimumLength = (s) => {
  let numDeletions = 0;
  const frequency = new Array(26).fill(0);

  for (let char of s) ++frequency[char.charCodeAt() - 97];

  for (let count of frequency) {
    // We cannot remove when count isn't at least 3
    if (count < 2) continue;
    // For odd counts, we can delete count - 1 characters
    if (count % 2) numDeletions += count - 1;
    // For even counts, we can delete count - 2 characters
    else numDeletions += count - 2;
  }

  // The remaining character count is the starting length minus our deletions
  return s.length - numDeletions;
};
```

```js
/* Approach: We do not have to keep track of what the string is like after each valid deletion.
Rather, we just track the frequency of each character. When we encounter a frequency of at least 3, it
means we can successfully perform a deletion.
*/
const minimumLength = (s) => {
  let result = s.length;
  const frequency = new Array(26).fill(0);

  for (let char of s) ++frequency[char.charCodeAt() - 97];

  let index = 0;
  while (index < 26) {
    if (frequency[index] >= 3) {
      result -= 2;
      frequency[index] -= 2;
    } else ++index;
  }

  return result;
};
```
