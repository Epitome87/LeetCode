# [1657. Determine if Two Strings Are Close](https://leetcode.com/problems/determine-if-two-strings-are-close)

## Description

Two strings are considered **close** if you can attain one from the other using the following operations:

- Operation 1: Swap any two **existing** characters.
  - For example, `abcde -> aecdb`
- Operation 2: Transform **every** occurrence of one **existing** character into another **existing** character, and do the same with the other character.
  - For example, `aacabb -> bbcbaa` (all `a`'s turn into `b`'s, and all `b`'s turn into `a`'s)

You can use the operations on either string as many times as necessary.

Given two strings, `word1` and `word2`, return `true` _if_ `word1` _and_ `word2` _are **close**, and_ `false` _otherwise._

**Example 1:**

**Input:** word1 = "abc", word2 = "bca"  
**Output:** true  
**Explanation:** You can attain word2 from word1 in 2 operations.  
Apply Operation 1: "abc" -> "acb"  
Apply Operation 1: "acb" -> "bca"

**Example 2:**

**Input:** word1 = "a", word2 = "aa"  
**Output:** false  
**Explanation:** It is impossible to attain word2 from word1, or vice versa, in any number of operations.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** word1 = "cabbba", word2 = "abbccc"  
**Output:** true  
**Explanation:** You can attain word2 from word1 in 3 operations.  
Apply Operation 1: "cabbba" -> "caabbb"  
Apply Operation 2: "caabbb" -> "baaccc"  
Apply Operation 2: "baaccc" -> "abbccc"

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 10^5`
- `word1` and `word2` contain only lowercase English letters.

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
/*
Approach: Note that operation 1 essentially means word1 and word2 just need the same
character counts (at least at some point, before operation 2 takes place).
Operation 2 means we can swap the frequency of any character.
Consequently, to be "close" we only need both words to contain the same characters and 
same set of character frequencies, regardless of what character the frequencies are for.
*/
const closeStrings = (word1, word2) => {
  // Return early if unequal lengths.
  // We could leave this out and the algorithm would still succeed
  if (word1.length !== word2.length) return false;

  // Build up frequency counts for both words
  const freq1 = new Array(26).fill(0);
  const freq2 = new Array(26).fill(0);

  for (let char of word1) {
    freq1[char.charCodeAt() - 97]++;
  }

  for (let char of word2) {
    freq2[char.charCodeAt() - 97]++;
  }

  // Ensure that if a character appears in one word, it appears in the other
  for (let i = 0; i < 26; ++i) {
    if ((freq1[i] && !freq2[i]) || (freq2[i] && !freq1[i])) {
      return false;
    }
  }

  // Finally, check that we have the same set of frequencies, regardless of the char they belong to.
  // For example, if we have freq arrays of [1, 0, 3] and [1, 3, 0], they are the same.
  // The simplest way to do this is to sort the frequency arrays
  freq1.sort((a, b) => a - b);
  freq2.sort((a, b) => a - b);

  for (let i = 0; i < 26; ++i) {
    if (freq1[i] !== freq2[i]) {
      return false;
    }
  }

  // By this point none of our fail conditions were met; so these words are close!
  return true;
};
```
