# [1838. Frequency of the Most Frequent Element](https://leetcode.com/problems/frequency-of-the-most-frequent-element)

## Description

The **frequency** of an element is the number of times it occurs in an array.

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. In one operation, you can choose an index of `nums` and increment the element at that index by `1`.

Return _the **maximum possible frequency** of an element after performing **at most**_ `k` _operations_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,2,4\], k = 5  
**Output:** 3  
**Explanation:** Increment the first element three times and the second element two times to make nums = \[4,4,4\].
4 has a frequency of 3.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,4,8,13\], k = 5  
**Output:** 2  
**Explanation:** There are multiple optimal solutions:

- Increment the first element three times to make nums = \[4,4,8,13\]. 4 has a frequency of 2.
- Increment the second element four times to make nums = \[1,8,8,13\]. 8 has a frequency of 2.
- Increment the third element five times to make nums = \[1,4,13,13\]. 13 has a frequency of 2.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = \[3,9,6\], k = 2  
**Output:** 1

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`
- `1 <= k <= 10^5`

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
const maxFrequency = (nums, k) => {
  let result = 0;

  // We will need to track the sum of all numbers in our sliding window
  let curSum = 0;

  // For each number, potential candidates to make equal to number (to increase frequency)
  // will be numbers closest in value to the number. So sorting the input will help greatly.
  const sortedNums = nums.toSorted((a, b) => a - b);

  for (let start = 0, end = 0; end < sortedNums.length; ++end) {
    // Add the contribution of sortedNums[end] to the current sum.
    curSum += sortedNums[end];

    // The key to our window logic: By using the sum of the window, we can
    // determine if we have enough k to increment each number in the window
    // to be the same as sortedNums[end]. Example: Increasing [1, 1, 3, 3] so each num
    // is 3 would require 4 increments (3 * 4) - 8, i.e num[end] * windowSize - sum
    while (curSum + k < sortedNums[end] * (end - start + 1)) {
      // Remove the contribution of sortedNums[start] to current sum
      curSum -= sortedNums[start];

      // And shrink the window
      ++start;
    }

    // Find if the new window length is larger than the current largest
    result = Math.max(result, end - start + 1);
  }

  return result;
};
```
