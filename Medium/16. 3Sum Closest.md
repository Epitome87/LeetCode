# [16. 3Sum Closest](https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum-closest)

## Description

Given an integer array `nums` of length `n` and an integer `target`, find three integers in `nums` such that the sum is closest to `target`.

Return _the sum of the three integers_.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[-1,2,1,-4\], target = 1  
**Output:** 2  
**Explanation:** The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[0,0,0\], target = 1  
**Output:** 0  
**Explanation:** The sum that is closest to the target is 0. (0 + 0 + 0 = 0).

**Constraints:**

- `3 <= nums.length <= 500`
- `-1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000`
- `-10^4 <= target <= 10^4`
-

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
const threeSumClosest = (nums, target) => {
  // Sort the numbers so we can perform a two-pointer 2sum
  nums.sort((a, b) => a - b);

  // Our closest sum at the start is a very large number!
  let closestSum = Infinity;

  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length - 2; i++) {
    // For each index i, we will perform a two sum, using nums[i]
    // as A. We will find a B and C such that A + B + C is as close to
    // target as possible
    let left = i + 1;
    let right = nums.length - 1;

    while (left < right) {
      const sum = nums[i] + nums[left] + nums[right];

      // Update closest sum reached, if necessary
      if (Math.abs(target - sum) < Math.abs(target - closestSum)) closestSum = sum;

      // Return early if we can exactly sum to target!
      if (sum === target) return sum;

      // Otherwise, shrink our two pointers appropriately
      if (sum < target) left++;
      else right--;
    }
  }

  return closestSum;
};
```
