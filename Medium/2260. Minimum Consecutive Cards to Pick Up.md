# [2260. Minimum Consecutive Cards to Pick Up](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-consecutive-cards-to-pick-up)

## Description

You are given an integer array `cards` where `cards[i]` represents the **value** of the `ith` card. A pair of cards are **matching** if the cards have the **same** value.

Return _the **minimum** number of **consecutive** cards you have to pick up to have a pair of **matching** cards among the picked cards._ If it is impossible to have matching cards, return `-1`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** cards = \[3,4,2,3,4,7\]  
**Output:** 4  
**Explanation:** We can pick up the cards \[3,4,2,3\] which contain a matching pair of cards with value 3. Note that picking up the cards \[4,2,3,4\] is also optimal.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** cards = \[1,0,5,3\]  
**Output:** -1  
**Explanation:** There is no way to pick up a set of consecutive cards that contain a pair of matching cards.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= cards.length <= 10^5`
- `0 <= cards[i] <= 10^6`

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
// Approach: Sliding Window
const minimumCardPickup = (cards) => {
  let result = Infinity;
  const set = new Set();
  let start = 0;
  let end = 0;

  while (end < cards.length) {
    // If we've found matching cards, shrink window until we have not
    // All along the way we keep track of the smallest valid window
    while (set.has(cards[end])) {
      result = Math.min(result, end - start + 1);

      // Remove the contribution of the left-most card, which is now leaving the window
      set.delete(cards[start]);
      start++;
    }

    // Note above we are CONSIDERING the contribution of the right-most card
    // However, we have to actually add it to the set so we can consider its future contributions
    // Add the contribution of the right-most card
    set.add(cards[end]);
    end++;
  }

  return result === Infinity ? -1 : result;
};
```

```js
const minimumCardPickup = (cards) => {
  let result = Infinity;

  // Map a card to the index it was last found at
  let last = {};

  for (let i = 0; i < cards.length; i++) {
    // Has this card been seen before?
    // Then find the distance between this and the last time it occurred
    if (cards[i] in last) result = Math.min(result, i - last[cards[i]] + 1);

    // Keep track of the last index this card was found at
    last[cards[i]] = i;
  }

  return result === Infinity ? -1 : result;
};
```

```js
const minimumCardPickup = (cards) => {
  let result = Infinity;
  let last = new Array(1_000_001); // Constraint is 0 <= cards[i] <= 10^6

  for (let i = 0; i < cards.length; i++) {
    // Has this card been seen before?
    if (last[cards[i]]) result = Math.min(result, i - last[cards[i]] + 2);

    // Keep track of the last index this card was found at
    last[cards[i]] = i + 1;
  }

  return result === Infinity ? -1 : result;
};
```
