# [5. Longest Palindromic Substring](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-substring)

## Description

Given a string `s`, return _the longest palindromic substring_ in `s`. A **substring** is a contiguous **non-empty** sequence of characters within a string.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "babad"  
**Output:** "bab"  
**Explanation:** "aba" is also a valid answer.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "cbbd"  
**Output:** "bb"

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
- `s` consist of only digits and English letters.

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
/*
Approach: At each index i, expand outward until string is no longer palindromic.
Rather than repeating logic for odd / even length strings, we expand the right pointer
outward until it finds a character not equal to the current index i. This trick eliminates
the need for expanding string on left = i, right = i (odd strings) and left = i, right = i + 1 (even)
*/
const longestPalindrome = (s) => {
  let longestPalindrome = '';
  let longestPalindromeLength = 0;

  for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
    let right = i;

    // Increment right until we find a char not equal to s[i]
    // This will help us deal with the subtle differences in logic between
    // odd and even length palindromes.
    while (right < s.length && s[i] === s[right]) right++;

    // We can now begin expanding a left and right pointer outward
    // Left starts out one character before our current index
    // Right ended up on the first non-duplicate char, so it's ready to go!
    left = i - 1;

    // Expand until we are out of bounds or are not palindromic
    while (left >= 0 && right < s.length && s[left] === s[right]) {
      left--;
      right++;
    }

    // s[left + 1, right - 1] inclusive is palindromic
    const palindrome = s.slice(left + 1, right);

    // Calculate newest palindromic string result, and its length
    if (palindrome.length > longestPalindromeLength) {
      longestPalindromeLength = palindrome.length;
      longestPalindrome = palindrome;
    }
  }

  return longestPalindrome;
};
```

```js
const longestPalindrome = (s) => {
  let result = '';

  // For every index, try extending out from that index and locate the longest palindrome
  // Note we must perform this extension twice -- one for odd lengths and one for even.
  for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
    str1 = extend(s, i, i); // Assume odd length palindrome
    str2 = extend(s, i, i + 1); // Assume even length palindrome

    // See if either string with index i as its center led to a new longest palindrome
    if (str1.length > result.length) result = str1;
    if (str2.length > result.length) result = str2;
  }

  return result;
};

const extend = (s, i, j) => {
  // Keep extending the length of the string until it is no longer a palindrome
  for (; i >= 0 && j < s.length; i--, j++) {
    if (s[i] !== s[j]) break;
  }

  // Return the longest substring that was still a palindrome
  // Note we do not include the final i-- or j++ in the slice, as
  // that was the first time the palindrome check failed.
  return s.slice(i + 1, j);
};
```
