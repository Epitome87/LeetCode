# [11. Container with Most Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water)

## Description

You are given an integer array `height` of length `n`. There are `n` vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the `ith` line are `(i, 0)` and `(i, height[i])`.

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return _the maximum amount of water a container can store_.

**Notice** that you may not slant the container.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: height = [1,1]
Output: 1
```

**Constraints:**

- n == height.length
- 2 <= n <= 10<sup>5</sup>
- 0 <= height[i] <= 10<sup>4</sup>

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
// Approach 2: Two Pointers
var maxArea = function (heights) {
  let max = 0;

  // We want to maximize the area, so start with greatest possible width,
  // i.e consider the heights at the start and end indices.
  let left = 0;
  let right = heights.length - 1;

  while (left < right) {
    // Grab the heights at left and right pointers
    const leftHeight = heights[left];
    const rightHeight = heights[right];

    // Our width is the difference between the indices
    const width = right - left;

    // Our height is the smaller of the two heights being considered
    const height = Math.min(leftHeight, rightHeight);

    // And finally, our area is the product of the width and height
    const area = width * height;

    // Update our potentially new largest area
    max = Math.max(max, area);

    // Let's intelligently move our window by neglecting
    // the smaller of the two
    if (leftHeight <= rightHeight) left++;
    else right--;
  }

  return max;
};
```

**Python**

```py
class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        left, right = 0, len(height) - 1
        result = 0

        while left < right:
            result = max(result, (right - left) * min(height[left], height[right]))
            if height[left] <= height[right]: left += 1
            else: right -= 1

        return result
```

| --------------- | ---------------- |
| O(N)            | O(1)             |

```js
// Approach 1: Brute-Force
var maxArea = function (heights) {
  let max = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < heights.length; i++) {
    for (let j = i + 1; j < heights.length; j++) {
      let area = (j - i) * Math.min(heights[i], heights[j]);
      max = Math.max(max, area);
    }
  }

  return max;
};
