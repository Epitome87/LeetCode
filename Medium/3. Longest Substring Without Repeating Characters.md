# [3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters)

## Description

Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

**Example 1:**

Input: s = "abcabcbb"  
Output: 3  
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.

**Example 2:**

Input: s = "bbbbb"  
Output: 1  
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.

**Example 3:**

Input: s = "pwwkew"  
Output: 3  
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.  
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.

**Constraints:**

- 0 <= s.length <= 5 \* 10<sup>4</sup>
- s consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
const lengthOfLongestSubstring = (s) => {
  const seen = new Set();
  let longest = 0;

  for (let left = 0, right = 0; right < s.length; right++) {
    while (seen.has(s[right])) {
      seen.delete(s[left]);
      left++;
    }
    seen.add(s[right]);
    longest = Math.max(longest, seen.size);
  }

  return longest;
};
```

            longest = max(longest, len(seen))

        return longest
