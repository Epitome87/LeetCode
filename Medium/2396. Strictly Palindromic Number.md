# [2396. Strictly Palindromic Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/strictly-palindromic-number)

## Description

An integer `n` is **strictly palindromic** if, for **every** base `b` between `2` and `n - 2` (**inclusive**), the string representation of the integer `n` in base `b` is **palindromic**.

Given an integer `n`, return `true` _if_ `n` _is **strictly palindromic** and_ `false` _otherwise_.

A string is **palindromic** if it reads the same forward and backward.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 9  
**Output:** false  
**Explanation:** In base 2: 9 = 1001 (base 2), which is palindromic.  
In base 3: 9 = 100 (base 3), which is not palindromic.  
Therefore, 9 is not strictly palindromic so we return false.  
Note that in bases 4, 5, 6, and 7, n = 9 is also not palindromic.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 4  
**Output:** false  
**Explanation:** We only consider base 2: 4 = 100 (base 2), which is not palindromic.  
Therefore, we return false.

**Constraints:**

- `4 <= n <= 10^5`

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
// Approach 1: Always return false!
// Observe that, given an integer n, that number in base n - 2 is always 12.
// 12 is not palindromic. Since we must consider the base n - 2 in every solution,
// we can never have a true solution.
const isStrictlyPalindromic = (n) => false;
```

| --------------- | ---------------- |
| O(1)            | O(1)             |

```js
// Approach 2:
// Let's assume we are not aware that base n - 2 always results in 12, which is not
// palindromic. Or let's assume the range of bases does not include n - 2. The brute-force
// solution could be as follows
const isStrictlyPalindromic = (n) => {
  for (let base = 2; base <= n - 2; base++) {
    const nBaseB = n.toString(base);
    if (!isPalindrome(nBaseB)) return false;
  }

  return true;
};

const isPalindrome = (str) => {
  let left = 0;
  let right = str.length - 1;

  while (left <= right) {
    if (str[left] !== str[right]) return false;
    left++;
    right--;
  }

  return true;
};
```

| O(N^2)?         | O(1)             |
