# [134. Gas Station](https://leetcode.com/problems/gas-station)

## Description

There are `n` gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at the `ith` station is `gas[i]`.

You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs `cost[i]` of gas to travel from the `ith` station to its next `(i + 1)th` station. You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.

Given two integer arrays `gas` and `cost`, return _the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return_ `-1`. If there exists a solution, it is **guaranteed** to be **unique**.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** gas = \[1,2,3,4,5\], cost = \[3,4,5,1,2\]  
**Output:** 3  
**Explanation:**  
Start at station 3 (index 3) and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4  
Travel to station 4. Your tank = 4 - 1 + 5 = 8  
Travel to station 0. Your tank = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7  
Travel to station 1. Your tank = 7 - 3 + 2 = 6  
Travel to station 2. Your tank = 6 - 4 + 3 = 5  
Travel to station 3. The cost is 5. Your gas is just enough to travel back to station 3.  
Therefore, return 3 as the starting index.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** gas = \[2,3,4\], cost = \[3,4,3\]  
**Output:** -1  
**Explanation:**  
You can't start at station 0 or 1, as there is not enough gas to travel to the next station.  
Let's start at station 2 and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4  
Travel to station 0. Your tank = 4 - 3 + 2 = 3  
Travel to station 1. Your tank = 3 - 3 + 3 = 3  
You cannot travel back to station 2, as it requires 4 unit of gas but you only have 3.  
Therefore, you can't travel around the circuit once no matter where you start.

**Constraints:**

- `n == gas.length == cost.length`
- `1 <= n <= 10^5`
- `0 <= gas[i], cost[i] <= 10^4`
- The input is generated such that the answer is unique.

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
const canCompleteCircuit = (gas, cost) => {
  const n = gas.length;
  let totalSurplus = 0; // Total delta between gas required and cost required
  let surplus = 0; // Amount of gas in the tank
  let startIdx = 0;

  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    totalSurplus += gas[i] - cost[i];
    surplus += gas[i] - cost[i];

    // If we ran out of fuel, this starting gas station was invalid.
    // Furthermore, all stations that occur between it and where we ran out of gas
    // are also invalid. So set our next starting index to i + 1
    if (surplus < 0) {
      surplus = 0;
      startIdx = i + 1;
    }
  }

  return totalSurplus < 0 ? -1 : startIdx;
};
```

```js
const canCompleteCircuit = (gas, cost) => {

  let total = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < gas.length; i++) {
    total += gas[i] - cost[i];
  }

  if (total < 0) return -1;

  // Now that we know there is a solution, find it!
  let tank = 0;
  let start = 0;

  for (let i = 0; i < gas.length; i++) {
    tank += gas[i] - cost[i];

    if (tank < 0) {
      start = i + 1;
      tank = 0;
    }
  }

  return start;

const canCompleteCircuit = (gas, cost) => {

  for (let i = 0; i < gas.length; i++) {
    let totalFuel = 0;
    let stopCount = 0;
    let stationIdx = i;

    // Check while there are still stations left to visit
    while (stopCount < n) {
      totalFuel += gas[stationIdx % n] - cost[stationIdx % n];
      // If we ran out of fuel, we know all the indices from 0 to the index we ran out of gas
      // at are invalid starting options. So skip all these and resume at the station after where we ran out.
      if (totalFuel < 0) {
        i = stationIdx; // The only change required from our Brute-Force solution!
        break;
      }

      stopCount++;
      stationIdx++;
    }

    if (stopCount === n && totalFuel >= 0) return i;
  }

  return -1;
};

    let totalFuel = 0;
    let stopCount = 0;
    let stationIdx = i;

    // Check while there are still stations left to visit
    while (stopCount < n) {

      if (totalFuel < 0) break;
      stopCount++;
      stationIdx++;
    }

    if (stopCount === n && totalFuel >= 0) return i;
  }

  return -1;
};
