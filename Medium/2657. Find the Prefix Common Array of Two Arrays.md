# [2657. Find the Prefix Common Array of Two Arrays](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-prefix-common-array-of-two-arrays)

## Description

You are given two **0-indexed** integer permutations `A` and `B` of length `n`.

A **prefix common array** of `A` and `B` is an array `C` such that `C[i]` is equal to the count of numbers that are present at or before the index `i` in both `A` and `B`.

Return _the **prefix common array** of_ `A` _and_ `B`.

A sequence of `n` integers is called aÂ **permutation** if it contains all integers from `1` to `n` exactly once.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** A = \[1,3,2,4\], B = \[3,1,2,4\]  
**Output:** \[0,2,3,4\]  
**Explanation:** At i = 0: no number is common, so C\[0\] = 0.  
At i = 1: 1 and 3 are common in A and B, so C\[1\] = 2.  
At i = 2: 1, 2, and 3 are common in A and B, so C\[2\] = 3.  
At i = 3: 1, 2, 3, and 4 are common in A and B, so C\[3\] = 4.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** A = \[2,3,1\], B = \[3,1,2\]  
**Output:** \[0,1,3\]  
**Explanation:** At i = 0: no number is common, so C\[0\] = 0.  
At i = 1: only 3 is common in A and B, so C\[1\] = 1.  
At i = 2: 1, 2, and 3 are common in A and B, so C\[2\] = 3.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= A.length == B.length == n <= 50`
- `1 <= A[i], B[i] <= n`
- `It is guaranteed that A and B are both a permutation of n integers.`

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
// Approach: Using a frequency map to count how often a number has occurred.
// Once the number has occurred twice it means it appeared once in each array
// (since we are working with permutations of numbers 1-n for each array).
const findThePrefixCommonArray = (A, B) => {
  const result = [];
  const freq = new Array(A.length + 1).fill(0); // Range is [1, n]
  let numCommon = 0;

  for (let i = 0; i < A.length; ++i) {
    if (++freq[A[i]] === 2) ++numCommon;
    if (++freq[B[i]] === 2) ++numCommon;
    result.push(numCommon);
  }

  return result;
};
```

| Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
| --------------- | ---------------- |
| O(N)            | O(N)             |

```js
// Approach: Using one Set
const findThePrefixCommonArray = (A, B) => {
  const result = [];
  const seen = new Set();
  let numCommon = 0;

  for (let i = 0; i < A.length; ++i) {
    if (seen.has(A[i])) ++numCommon;
    else seen.add(A[i]);

    if (seen.has(B[i])) ++numCommon;
    else seen.add(B[i]);

    result.push(numCommon);
  }

  return result;
};
```
