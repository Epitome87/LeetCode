# [525. Contiguous Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/contiguous-array)

## Description

Given a binary array `nums`, return _the maximum length of a contiguous subarray with an equal number of_ `0` _and_ `1`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[0,1\]  
**Output:** 2  
**Explanation:** \[0, 1\] is the longest contiguous subarray with an equal number of 0 and 1.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[0,1,0\]  
**Output:** 2  
**Explanation:** \[0, 1\] (or \[1, 0\]) is a longest contiguous subarray with equal number of 0 and 1.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = \[0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0\]  
**Output:** 6  
**Explanation:** \[1,1,1,0,0,0\] is the longest contiguous subarray with equal number of 0 and 1.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `nums[i]` is either `0` or `1`.

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
/* Approach: Keep a rolling sum, which increments by 1 when we encounter a 1 and decrements by 1 when we encounter a 0. Every time we reach a sum of 0 we can update our result to the current index + 1 (i.e the full length of the nums array visited so far). When we encounter
any other sum we set that sum as a key in our hash map and the index it first occurred at as the value. The next time we encounter a sum that's in the hash map it means we have seen this sum before, i.e we have seen that amount of 0's vs 1's. This means the numbers in the range between the current index and the last seen index have an equal number of 0's and 1's, so they are a potential result.
*/
const findMaxLength = (nums) => {
  let result = 0;
  let sum = 0;
  // Map the sums we have seen with the index it first occurred at.
  // We initialize it with 0: -1 so that when we encounter a sum of 0 for the first time
  // we can properly set that as a result
  const seen = { 0: -1 };

  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; ++i) {
    sum += nums[i] === 0 ? -1 : 1;
    // if (sum === 0) result = i + 1; // Not necessary if we initialize seen with { 0: - 1}
    if (sum in seen) result = Math.max(result, i - seen[sum]);
    else seen[sum] = i;
  }

  return result;
};
```

```js
// Approach: Brute-Force (Time Limit Exceeded!)
const findMaxLength = (nums) => {
  let result = 0;

  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; ++i) {
    let zeroes = 0;
    let ones = 0;

    for (let j = i; j < nums.length; ++j) {
      if (nums[j] === 0) ++zeroes;
      else ++ones;
      if (zeroes === ones) {
        result = Math.max(result, j - i + 1);
      }
    }
  }

  return result;
};
