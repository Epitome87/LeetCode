# [42. Trapping Rain Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water)

## Description

Given `n` non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is `1`, compute how much water it can trap after raining.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
Output: 6
Explanation: The above elevation map (black section) is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: height = [4,2,0,3,2,5]
Output: 9
```

**Constraints:**

- n == height.length
- 1 <= n <= 2 \* 10<sup>4</sup>
- 0 <= height[i] <= 10<sup>5</sup>

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
const trap = function (height) {
  // Our result -- the amount of water trapped in total
  let totalWaterTrapped = 0;

  // Arrays to store the largest height to the left of i and
  // the right of i, respectively. This is necessary for determining
  // the boundaries at each height.
  const leftMax = Array(height.length).fill(0);
  const rightMax = Array(height.length).fill(0);

  for (let i = 1; i < height.length; i++) leftMax[i] = Math.max(leftMax[i - 1], height[i - 1]);

  for (let i = height.length - 2; i >= 0; i--) rightMax[i] = Math.max(rightMax[i + 1], height[i + 1]);

  for (let i = 0; i < height.length; i++) {
    // Our boundary is the smaller of the left largest or right largest heights
    const boundaryHeight = Math.min(leftMax[i], rightMax[i]);

    // This position traps its boundary height minus its own height
    const waterTrapped = boundaryHeight - height[i];

    // But if this value is negative, that means no water can actually be trapped
    // So we treat negative values as 0
    totalWaterTrapped += Math.max(waterTrapped, 0);
  }

  return totalWaterTrapped;
};
```
