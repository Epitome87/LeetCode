# [496. Next Greater Element](https://leetcode.com/problems/next-greater-element)

## Description

The **next greater element** of some element `x` in an array is the **first greater** element that is **to the right** of `x` in the same array.

You are given two **distinct 0-indexed** integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, where `nums1` is a subset of `nums2`.

For each `0 <= i < nums1.length`, find the index `j` such that `nums1[i] == nums2[j]` and determine the **next greater element** of `nums2[j]` in `nums2`. If there is no next greater element, then the answer for this query is `-1`.

Return _an array_ `ans` _of length_ `nums1.length` _such that_ `ans[i]` _is the **next greater element** as described above._

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums1 = \[4,1,2\], nums2 = \[1,3,4,2\]  
**Output:** \[-1,3,-1\]  
**Explanation:** The next greater element for each value of nums1 is as follows:

- 4 is underlined in nums2 = \[1,3,4,2\]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.
- 1 is underlined in nums2 = \[1,3,4,2\]. The next greater element is 3.
- 2 is underlined in nums2 = \[1,3,4,2\]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums1 = \[2,4\], nums2 = \[1,2,3,4\]  
**Output:** \[3,-1\]  
**Explanation:** The next greater element for each value of nums1 is as follows:

- 2 is underlined in nums2 = \[1,2,3,4\]. The next greater element is 3.
- 4 is underlined in nums2 = \[1,2,3,4\]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums1.length <= nums2.length <= 1000`
- `0 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 10^4`
- All integers in `nums1` and `nums2` are **unique**.
- All the integers of `nums1` also appear in `nums2`.

**Follow up:** Could you find an `O(nums1.length + nums2.length)` solution?

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
// Approach: Monotonic Decreasing Stack
// Also a hashmap for O(1) lookup of indices
const nextGreaterElement = (nums1, nums2) => {
  const result = Array(nums1.length).fill(-1);
  const stack = [];

  // Map each value in nums1 to the index it occurs at
  const indexMap = nums1.reduce((acc, cur, idx) => ((acc[cur] = idx), acc), {});

  // Iterate through nums2
  for (let i = 0; i < nums2.length; i++) {
    // And while the current element in nums2 is greater than the element at the top of the stack...
    while (stack.length && stack.at(-1) < nums2[i]) {
      // Pop that element from the stack
      const lastValue = stack.pop();

      // Find out which index it occurred at
      const lastValueIdx = indexMap[lastValue];

      // Tap into that index in our result array and set it equal to the current nums2 element,
      // as this is the element that is the first one greater than the element on the stack
      result[lastValueIdx] = nums2[i];
    }

    // We have exhausted all smaller values on the stack. Now we need to see if we should push
    // the current nums2 to the stack. We only want it if it occurred in nums1
    if (nums2[i] in indexMap) stack.push(nums2[i]);
  }

  return result;
};
```

| Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
| --------------- | ---------------- |
| O(M + N)        | O(M)             |

```js
// Approach: Brute-Force
const nextGreaterElement = (nums1, nums2) => {
  const result = [];

  for (let n of nums1) {
    // What index can this number be found at within nums2?
    const idx = nums2.indexOf(n);

    // Find from the subarray after this index the first greater number
    // If none are found, we push -1 to the results instead
    const nextGreater = nums2.slice(idx).find((v) => v > n) ?? -1;
    result.push(nextGreater);
  }

  return result;
};
```
