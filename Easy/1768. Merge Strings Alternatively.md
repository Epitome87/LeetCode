# [1768. Merge Strings Alternatively](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-strings-alternatively)

## Description

You are given two strings `word1` and `word2`. Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with `word1`. If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.

Return _the merged string._

**Example 1:**

**Input:** word1 = "abc", word2 = "pqr"  
**Output:** "apbqcr"  
**Explanation:** The merged string will be merged as so:  
word1: a b c  
word2: p q r  
merged: a p b q c r

**Example 2:**

**Input:** word1 = "ab", word2 = "pqrs"  
**Output:** "apbqrs"  
**Explanation:** Notice that as word2 is longer, "rs" is appended to the end.  
word1: a b  
word2: p q r s  
merged: a p b q r s

**Example 3:**

**Input:** word1 = "abcd", word2 = "pq"  
**Output:** "apbqcd"  
**Explanation:** Notice that as word1 is longer, "cd" is appended to the end.  
word1: a b c d  
word2: p q  
merged: a p b q c d

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 100`
- `word1` and `word2` consist of lowercase English letters.

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
const mergeAlternately = (word1, word2) => {
  let result = '';

  for (let i = 0; i < Math.max(word1.length, word2.length); i++) {
    word1[i] && (result += word1[i]);
    word2[i] && (result += word2[i]);
  }

  return result;
};
```
