# [1009. Complement of Base 10 Integer](https://leetcode.com/problems/complement-of-base-10-integer)

## Description

The **complement** of an integer is the integer you get when you flip all the `0`'s to `1`'s and all the `1`'s to `0`'s in its binary representation.

- For example, The integer `5` is `"101"` in binary and its **complement** is `"010"` which is the integer `2`.

Given an integer `n`, return _its complement_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 5  
**Output:** 2  
**Explanation:** 5 is "101" in binary, with complement "010" in binary, which is 2 in base-10.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 7  
**Output:** 0  
**Explanation:** 7 is "111" in binary, with complement "000" in binary, which is 0 in base-10.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** n = 10  
**Output:** 5  
**Explanation:** 10 is "1010" in binary, with complement "0101" in binary, which is 5 in base-10.

**Constraints:**

- `0 <= n < 10^9`

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
const bitwiseComplement = (n) => {
  let mask = 1;

  while (mask < n) {
    mask = (mask << 1) + 1;
  }

  return mask ^ n;
};
```

| Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
| --------------- | ---------------- |
| O(Log(N))       | O(1)             |

```js
// Find the first number x such that x = 1111...1 > n
// We do this because n + complement = 1111...1
// So complement = 1111...1 - n
const bitwiseComplement = (n) => {
  let x = 1;

  while (n > x) {
    x = x * 2 + 1;
  }

  return x - n;
};
```

| Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
| --------------- | ---------------- |
| O(Log(N))       | O(1)             |

**Python**

```python
def bitwiseComplement(self, n: int) -> int:
    mask = 1

    while mask < n:
        mask = (mask << 1) + 1

    return mask ^ n
```

| Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
| --------------- | ---------------- |
| O(Log(N))       | O(1)             |

**Java**

```java
public int bitwiseComplement(int n) {
    int mask = 1;

    while (mask < n) {
        mask = (mask << 1) + 1;
    }

    return mask ^ n;
}
```

| --------------- | ---------------- |
| O(Log(N))       | O(1)             |
