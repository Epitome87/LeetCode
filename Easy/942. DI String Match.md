# [942. DI String Match](https://leetcode.com/problems/di-string-match)

## Description

A permutation `perm` of `n + 1` integers of all the integers in the range `[0, n]` can be represented as a string `s` of length `n` where:

- `s[i] == 'I'` if `perm[i] < perm[i + 1]`, and
- `s[i] == 'D'` if `perm[i] > perm[i + 1]`.

Given a string `s`, reconstruct the permutation `perm` and return it. If there are multiple valid permutations perm, return **any of them**.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "IDID"  
**Output:** \[0,4,1,3,2\]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "III"  
**Output:** \[0,1,2,3\]

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s = "DDI"  
**Output:** \[3,2,0,1\]

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`
- `s[i]` is either `'I'` or `'D'`.

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
/*
Approach: Two Pointer
We set our left pointer to the lowest possible value, 0, and the right pointer
to the highest, n. For every element in s, if is an 'I' that means result[i] < reslt[i + 1].
To ensure this is the case, we set result[i] to the first available lowest number. When s[i] is 'D'
we set it to the first available highest number. We shift our two pointers appropriately. When we are done
iterating through s there will be one left-over number to put at the end of the result array. At this point
both the left and right pointer will be equal to this number, so set result[-1] equal to either.
*/
const diStringMatch = (s) => {
  const result = new Array(s.length + 1);
  let right = s.length;
  let left = 0;

  // JS lets us safely iterate out-of-bounds, so no need to
  // manually set result[result.length - 1] = left at the end.
  for (let i = 0; i <= s.length; ++i) {
    if (s[i] === 'I') result[i] = left++;
    else result[i] = right--;
  }

  return result;
};
```
