# [374. Guess Number Higher or Lower](https://leetcode.com/problems/guess-number-higher-or-lower)

## Description

We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

I pick a number from `1` to `n`. You have to guess which number I picked.

Every time you guess wrong, I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower than your guess.

You call a pre-defined API `int guess(int num)`, which returns three possible results:

- `-1`: Your guess is higher than the number I picked (i.e. `num > pick`).
- `1`: Your guess is lower than the number I picked (i.e. `num < pick`).
- `0`: your guess is equal to the number I picked (i.e. `num == pick`).

Return _the number that I picked_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 10, pick = 6  
**Output:** 6

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 1, pick = 1  
**Output:** 1

**Example 3:**

**Input:** n = 2, pick = 1  
**Output:** 1

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 231 - 1`
- `1 <= pick <= n`

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
const guessNumber = (n) => {
  let left = 1;
  let right = n;

  while (left < right) {
    const middle = left + Math.floor((right - left) / 2);
    const guessResult = guess(middle);

    if (guessResult <= 0) right = middle;
    else left = middle + 1;
  }

  return left;
};
```

```js
const guessNumber = (n) => {
  let left = 1;
  let right = n;

  while (left <= right) {
    const middle = left + Math.floor((right - left) / 2);
    const guessResult = guess(middle);

    if (guessResult === 0) return middle;
    if (guessResult < 0) right = middle - 1;
    else left = middle + 1;
  }
};
```
