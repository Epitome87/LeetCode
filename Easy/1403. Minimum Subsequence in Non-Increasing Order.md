# [1403. Minimum Subsequence in Non-Increasing Order](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-subsequence-in-non-increasing-order)

## Description

Given the array `nums`, obtain a subsequence of the array whose sum of elements is **strictly greater** than the sum of the non included elements in such subsequence.

If there are multiple solutions, return the subsequence with **minimum size** and if there still exist multiple solutions, return the subsequence with the **maximum total sum** of all its elements. A subsequence of an array can be obtained by erasing some (possibly zero) elements from the array.

Note that the solution with the given constraints is guaranteed to be **unique**. Also return the answer sorted in **non-increasing** order.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[4,3,10,9,8\]
**Output:** \[10,9\]
**Explanation:** The subsequences \[10,9\] and \[10,8\] are minimal such that the sum of their elements is strictly greater than the sum of elements not included. However, the subsequence \[10,9\] has the maximum total sum of its elements.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[4,4,7,6,7\]
**Output:** \[7,7,6\]
**Explanation:** The subsequence \[7,7\] has the sum of its elements equal to 14 which is not strictly greater than the sum of elements not included (14 = 4 + 4 + 6). Therefore, the subsequence \[7,6,7\] is the minimal satisfying the conditions. Note the subsequence has to be returned in non-increasing order.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 500`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 100`

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
const minSubsequence = (nums) => {
  const count = new Array(101).fill(0);
  let totalSum = 0;

  for (let num of nums) {
    totalSum += num;
    count[num]++;
  }

  const result = [];
  let curSum = 0;

  for (let i = count.length - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
    while (count[i] > 0 && curSum <= totalSum - curSum) {
      result.push(i);
      curSum += i;
      count[i]--;
    }
  }

  return result;
};
```

| Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
| --------------- | ---------------- |
| O(N)            | O(1)             |

```js
const minSubsequence = (nums) => {
  const totalSum = nums.reduce((acc, cur) => acc + cur, 0);
  const sortedNums = nums.toSorted((a, b) => b - a);
  let sum = 0;

  for (let i = 0; i < sortedNums.length; ++i) {
    sum += sortedNums[i];

    // If the current rolling sum is greater than the sum of the remaining elements, we have potential result.
    // Since we sorted, we are assured the first potential result is the best result, i.e one with greatest sum / least elements.
    if (sum > totalSum - sum) return sortedNums.slice(0, i + 1);
  }
};
```
