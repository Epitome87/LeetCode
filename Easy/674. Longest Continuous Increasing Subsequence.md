# [674. Longest Continuous Increasing Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-continuous-increasing-subsequence)

## Description

Given an unsorted array of integers `nums`, return _the length of the longest **continuous increasing subsequence** (i.e. subarray)_. The subsequence must be **strictly** increasing.

A **continuous increasing subsequence** is defined by two indices `l` and `r` (`l < r`) such that it is `[nums[l], nums[l + 1], ..., nums[r - 1], nums[r]]` and for each `l <= i < r`, `nums[i] < nums[i + 1]`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,3,5,4,7\]  
**Output:** 3  
**Explanation:** The longest continuous increasing subsequence is \[1,3,5\] with length 3.  
Even though \[1,3,5,7\] is an increasing subsequence, it is not continuous as elements 5 and 7 are separated by element 4.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[2,2,2,2,2\]  
**Output:** 1  
**Explanation:** The longest continuous increasing subsequence is \[2\] with length 1. Note that it must be strictly
increasing.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^4`
- `-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
const findLengthOfLCIS = (nums) => {
  let longestLength = 1;
  let length = 1;

  for (let i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
    if (nums[i] > nums[i - 1]) {
      length++;
      longestLength = Math.max(longestLength, length);
    } else length = 1;
  }

  return longestLength;
};
```

**Python**

```python
def findLengthOfLCIS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
    cur_length = 1
    max_length = 1

    for i in range(1, len(nums)):
        if nums[i] > nums[i - 1]:
            cur_length += 1
            max_length = max(max_length, cur_length)
        else:
            cur_length = 1

    return max_length
```
