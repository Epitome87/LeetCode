# [110. Balanced Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/balanced-binary-tree)

## Description

Given a binary tree, determine if it is **height-balanced**.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/06/balance_1.jpg)

**Input:** root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]  
**Output:** true

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/06/balance_2.jpg)

**Input:** root = [1,2,2,3,3,null,null,4,4]  
**Output:** false

**Example 3:**

**Input:** root = []  
**Output:** true

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 5000]`.
- `-10^4 <= Node.val <= 10^4`

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

Approach: Bottom-up!
Keep track of whether we are balanced AND the height of each subtree in an array.
By returning an array or object with the height of the current subtree and a boolean of
whether it is balanced, we can avoid duplicate logic.

```js
const isBalanced = (root) => {
  const dfs = (node) => {
    // Empty nodes are balanced, with a height of 0
    if (!node) return { balanced: true, height: 0 };

    // We want to evaluate our children first, to avoid duplicate processing
    const left = dfs(node.left);
    const right = dfs(node.right);

    const balanced = left.balanced && right.balanced && Math.abs(left.height - right.height) < 2;
    const height = 1 + Math.max(left.height, right.height);

    return { balanced, height };
  };

  return dfs(root).balanced;
};
```

| Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
| --------------- | ---------------- |
| O(N)            | O(H)             |

Approach: Typical traversal to find out height of tree.
But at each node, we see if the height of each children have
a delta of more than 1, at which point we set isBal to false.
In the end, we return the result of isBal.
The downside of this approach is that we still traverse the entire tree,
even after we've already discovered a subtree was unbalanced.

```js
const isBalanced = function (root) {
  let isBal = true;

  const maxDepth = (node) => {
    if (!node) return 0;
    const leftSub = maxDepth(node.left);
    const rightSub = maxDepth(node.right);
    if (Math.abs(leftSub - rightSub) > 1) isBal = false;
    return Math.max(leftSub, rightSub) + 1;
  };

  maxDepth(root);

  return isBal;
};
```

| Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
| --------------- | ---------------- |
| O(N)            | O(H)             |

Approach: With the assistance of getHeight, we visit each node
and see if each one is balanced
The downside of this is for each node, we have to do more recursion to
find the height of its subtrees. Essentially, we are doing N \* N work.

```js
var isBalanced = function (root) {
  const getHeight = (node) => {
    if (!node) return 0;
    return 1 + Math.max(getHeight(node.left), getHeight(node.right));
  };

  // Empty nodes are balanced
  if (!root) return true;

  // Am I balanced?
  const selfBalanced = Math.abs(getHeight(root.left) - getHeight(root.right)) < 2;

  // Are my children balanced?
  const childrenBalanced = isBalanced(root.left) && isBalanced(root.right);

  return selfBalanced && childrenBalanced;
};
```
