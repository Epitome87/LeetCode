# [3442. Maximum Difference Between Even and Odd Frequency I](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-difference-between-even-and-odd-frequency-i)

## Description

You are given a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters. Your task is to find the **maximum** difference between the frequency of **two** characters in the string such that:

- One of the characters has an **even frequency** in the string.
- The other character has an **odd frequency** in the string.

Return the **maximum** difference, calculated as the frequency of the character with an **odd** frequency **minus** the frequency of the character with an **even** frequency.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "aaaaabbc"  
**Output:** 3  
**Explanation:**

- The character `'a'` has an **odd frequency** of `5`, and `'b'` has an **even frequency** of `2`.
- The maximum difference is `5 - 2 = 3`.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "abcabcab"  
**Output:** 1  
**Explanation:**

- The character `'a'` has an **odd frequency** of `3`, and `'c'` has an **even frequency** of 2.
- The maximum difference is `3 - 2 = 1`.

**Constraints:**

- `3 <= s.length <= 100`
- `s` consists only of lowercase English letters.
- `s` contains at least one character with an odd frequency and one with an even frequency.

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
const maxDifference = (s) => {
  let smallestEven = Infinity;
  let greatestOdd = -Infinity;

  const frequency = {};

  for (const char of s) {
    frequency[char] = frequency[char] + 1 || 1;
  }

  for (let freq of Object.values(frequency)) {
    if (freq % 2) {
      greatestOdd = Math.max(greatestOdd, freq);
    } else {
      smallestEven = Math.min(smallestEven, freq);
    }
  }

  return greatestOdd - smallestEven;
};
```
