# [1022. Sum of Root to Leaf Binary Numbers](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-root-to-leaf-binary-numbers)

## Description

You are given the `root` of a binary tree where each node has a value `0` or `1`. Each root-to-leaf path represents a binary number starting with the most significant bit.

- For example, if the path is `0 -> 1 -> 1 -> 0 -> 1`, then this could represent `01101` in binary, which is `13`.

For all leaves in the tree, consider the numbers represented by the path from the root to that leaf. Return _the sum of these numbers_.

The test cases are generated so that the answer fits in a **32-bits** integer.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** root = \[1,0,1,0,1,0,1\]  
**Output:** 22  
**Explanation:** (100) + (101) + (110) + (111) = 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 22

**Example 2:**

**Input:** root = \[0\]  
**Output:** 0

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 1000]`.
- `Node.val` is `0` or `1`.

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
const dfs = (node, sum) => {
  if (!node) return 0;
  //val = val * 2 + node.val;   // Can use the line below to stick with bit operations
  sum = (sum << 1) | node.val; // Left shift by 1 bit, then add value (i.e 10 OR 0 = 10, 10 OR 1 = 11)

  // If we reach a leaf node (both children are null) we return the sum.
  // Else we continue our dfs by summing the dfs results of both children together
  return !node.left && !node.right ? sum : dfs(node.left, sum) + dfs(node.right, sum);
};

return dfs(root, 0);
```
