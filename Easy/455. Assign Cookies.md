# [455. Assign Cookies](https://leetcode.com/problems/assign-cookies)

## Description

Assume you are an awesome parent and want to give your children some cookies. But, you should give each child at most one cookie.

Each child `i` has a greed factor `g[i]`, which is the minimum size of a cookie that the child will be content with; and each cookie `j` has a size `s[j]`. If `s[j] >= g[i]`, we can assign the cookie `j` to the child `i`, and the child `i` will be content. Your goal is to maximize the number of your content children and output the maximum number.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** g = \[1,2,3\], s = \[1,1\]  
**Output:** 1  
**Explanation:** You have 3 children and 2 cookies. The greed factors of 3 children are 1, 2, 3.  
And even though you have 2 cookies, since their size is both 1, you could only make the child whose greed factor is 1 content.  
You need to output 1.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** g = \[1,2\], s = \[1,2,3\]  
**Output:** 2  
**Explanation:** You have 2 children and 3 cookies. The greed factors of 2 children are 1, 2.  
You have 3 cookies and their sizes are big enough to gratify all of the children,  
You need to output 2.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= g.length <= 3 * 10^4`
- `0 <= s.length <= 3 * 10^4`
- `1 <= g[i], s[j] <= 2^31 - 1`

**Note:** This question is the same as [2410: Maximum Matching of Players With Trainers.](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-matching-of-players-with-trainers/description/)

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
/*
Approach: Sort the inputs and take a Greedy approach!
We pair the biggest cookie with the greediest child on each iteration.
*/
const findContentChildren = (g, s) => {
  let result = 0;

  // Sort, give biggest cookie to greediest kid
  g.sort((a, b) => a - b);
  s.sort((a, b) => a - b);

  let gIdx = g.length - 1;
  let sIdx = s.length - 1;

  while (sIdx >= 0 && gIdx >= 0) {
    // Can the remaining largest cookie satisfy the remaining greediest child?
    if (s[sIdx] >= g[gIdx]) {
      // Then we increment our result!
      result++;

      // And move our search onto the next child...
      sIdx--;

      // As well as the next cookie
      gIdx--;
    } else gIdx--; //  Otherwise, move onto next child without adding to result or removing this cookie
  }

  return result;
};
```

| Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
| --------------- | ---------------- |
| O(N \* Log(N))  | O(Sorting)       |

**Python**

```python
def findContentChildren(self, g, s):
    g.sort()
    s.sort()

    result = 0
    gIdx = len(g) - 1
    sIdx = len(s) - 1

    while sIdx >= 0 and gIdx >= 0:
        if s[sIdx] >= g[gIdx]:
            result += 1
            sIdx -= 1
            gIdx -= 1
        else:
            gIdx -= 1

    return result
```
