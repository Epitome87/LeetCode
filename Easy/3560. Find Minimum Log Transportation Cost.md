# [3560. Find Minimum Log Transportation](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-log-transportation-cost)

## Description

You are given integers `n`, `m`, and `k`.

There are two logs of lengths `n` and `m` units, which need to be transported in three trucks where each truck can carry one log with length **at most** `k` units.

You may cut the logs into smaller pieces, where the cost of cutting a log of length `x` into logs of length `len1` and `len2` is `cost = len1 * len2` such that `len1 + len2 = x`.

Return the **minimum total cost** to distribute the logs onto the trucks. If the logs don't need to be cut, the total cost is 0.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 6, m = 5, k = 5  
**Output:** 5  
**Explanation:**  
Cut the log with length 6 into logs with length 1 and 5, at a cost equal to `1 * 5 == 5`. Now the three logs of length 1, 5, and 5 can fit in one truck each.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 4, m = 4, k = 6  
**Output:** 0  
**Explanation:**  
The two logs can fit in the trucks already, hence we don't need to cut the logs.

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= k <= 105`
- `1 <= n, m <= 2 * k`
- The input is generated such that it is always possible to transport the logs.

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
const minCuttingCost = (n, m, k) => {
  let result = 0;

  if (m > k && n <= k) result += (m - k) * k;
  if (n > k && m <= k) result += (n - k) * k;

  return result;
};
```
