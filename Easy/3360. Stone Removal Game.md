# [3360. Stone Removal Game](https://leetcode.com/problems/stone-removal-game)

## Description

Alice and Bob are playing a game where they take turns removing stones from a pile, with _Alice going first_.

- Alice starts by removing **exactly** 10 stones on her first turn.
- For each subsequent turn, each player removes **exactly** 1 fewer stone than the previous opponent.

The player who cannot make a move loses the game.

Given a positive integer `n`, return `true` if Alice wins the game and `false` otherwise.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 12  
**Output:** true  
**Explanation:**

- Alice removes 10 stones on her first turn, leaving 2 stones for Bob.
- Bob cannot remove 9 stones, so Alice wins.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 1  
**Output:** false  
**Explanation:**

- Alice cannot remove 10 stones, so Alice loses.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 50`

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
/*
Approach: Brute-Force by simulating the process.
We note that the constraints show a maximum stone count of 50.
This amount of stones leads to a 10-round game, which is small enough
to simulate!
*/
const canAliceWin = (n) => {
  let isAliceTurn = true;
  let numStones = 10;

  while (n >= 0) {
    n -= numStones;
    if (n < 0) return !isAliceTurn;
    --numStones;
    isAliceTurn = !isAliceTurn;
  }
};
```
