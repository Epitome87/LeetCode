# [463. Island Perimeter](https://leetcode.com/problems/island-perimeter)

## Description

You are given `row x col` `grid` representing a map where `grid[i][j] = 1` representsÂ land and `grid[i][j] = 0` represents water.

Grid cells are connected **horizontally/vertically** (not diagonally). The `grid` is completely surrounded by water, and there is exactly one island (i.e., one or more connected land cells).

The island doesn't have "lakes", meaning the water inside isn't connected to the water around the island. One cell is a square with side length 1. The grid is rectangular, width and height don't exceed 100. Determine the perimeter of the island.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/10/12/island.png)

**Input:** grid = [[0,1,0,0],[1,1,1,0],[0,1,0,0],[1,1,0,0]]  
**Output:** 16  
**Explanation:** The perimeter is the 16 yellow stripes in the image above.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** grid = [[1]]  
**Output:** 4

**Example 3:**

**Input:** grid = [[1,0]]  
**Output:** 4

**Constraints:**

- `row == grid.length`
- `col == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= row, col <= 100`
- `grid[i][j]` is `0` or `1`.
- There is exactly one island in `grid`.

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
const islandPerimeter = (grid) => {
  let perimeter = 0;

  for (let r = 0; r < grid.length; ++r) {
    for (let c = 0; c < grid[r].length; ++c) {
      // We aren't concerned with water cells
      if (grid[r][c] === 0) continue;

      // This land cell COULD contribute 4 to perimeter,
      // assuming it has no land neighbors.
      perimeter += 4;

      // But if it has a left or top neighbor, they share one side,
      // which reduces the perimeter by 2 for each side shared.
      // Since we are only checking two directions for each cell, we do not have to
      // worry about making duplicate checks, as no future neighbors will have their
      // same sides checked.
      if (r > 0 && grid[r - 1][c] === 1) perimeter -= 2; // Shared left side
      if (c > 0 && grid[r][c - 1] === 1) perimeter -= 2; // Shared top
    }
  }

  return perimeter;
};
```

**Python**

```python
def islandPerimeter(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    perimeter = 0

    for r in range(len(grid)):
        for c in range(len(grid[r])):
            if grid[r][c] == 0:
                continue
            perimeter += 4
            if r > 0 and grid[r - 1][c] == 1:
                perimeter -= 2
            if c > 0 and grid[r][c - 1] == 1:
                perimeter -= 2

    return perimeter
```
