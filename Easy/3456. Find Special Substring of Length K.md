# [3456. Find Special Substring of Length K](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-special-substring-of-length-k)

## Description

You are given a string `s` and an integer `k`.

Determine if there exists a substring of length **exactly** `k` in `s` that satisfies the following conditions:

1.  The substring consists of **only one distinct character** (e.g., `"aaa"` or `"bbb"`).
2.  If there is a character **immediately before** the substring, it must be different from the character in the substring.
3.  If there is a character **immediately after** the substring, it must also be different from the character in the substring.

Return `true` if such a substring exists. Otherwise, return `false`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "aaabaaa", k = 3  
**Output:** true  
**Explanation:**  
The substring `s[4..6] == "aaa"` satisfies the conditions.

- It has a length of 3.
- All characters are the same.
- The character before `"aaa"` is `'b'`, which is different from `'a'`.
- There is no character after `"aaa"`.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "abc", k = 2  
**Output:** false  
**Explanation:**  
There is no substring of length 2 that consists of one distinct character and satisfies the conditions.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= k <= s.length <= 100`
- `s` consists of lowercase English letters only.

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
const hasSpecialSubstring = (s, k) => {
  let count = 1;

  for (let i = 1; i < s.length; ++i) {
    if (s[i - 1] !== s[i] && count === k) return true;
    if (s[i - 1] !== s[i]) count = 0;
    ++count;
  }

  return count === k;
};
```

| --------------- | ---------------- |
| O(N)            | O(1)             |

**Python**

```python
def hasSpecialSubstring(self, s: str, k: int) -> bool:
    count = 1

    for i in range(1, len(s)):
        if s[i - 1] != s[i] and count == k:
            return True
        if s[i - 1] != s[i]:
            count = 0
        count += 1

    return count == k
```
