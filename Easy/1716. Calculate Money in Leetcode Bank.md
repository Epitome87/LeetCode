# [1716. Calculate Money in Leetcode Bank](https://leetcode.com/problems/calculate-money-in-leetcode-bank)

## Description

Hercy wants to save money for his first car. He puts money in the Leetcode bank **every day**.

He starts by putting in `$1` on Monday, the first day. Every day from Tuesday to Sunday, he will put in `$1` more than the day before. On every subsequent Monday, he will put in `$1` more than the **previous Monday**.

Given `n`, return _the total amount of money he will have in the Leetcode bank at the end of the_ `nth` _day._

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 4  
**Output:** 10  
**Explanation:** After the 4th day, the total is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 10  
**Output:** 37  
**Explanation:** After the 10th day, the total is (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7) + (2 + 3 + 4) = 37. Notice that on the 2nd Monday, Hercy only puts in $2.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** n = 20  
**Output:** 96  
**Explanation:** After the 20th day, the total is (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7) + (2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8) + (3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8) = 96.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 1000`

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
// Approach 3: Pure math!
const totalMoney = function (n) {
  // Calculate how many full weeks there are
  const weeks = Math.floor(n / 7);

  // As well as the remaining days after those weeks
  const days = n % 7;

  // Calculate the sum of the complete weeks
  let result = ((weeks * (weeks - 1)) / 2) * 7;

  // Calculate the sum from days beyond the complete weeks
  result += weeks * 28;

  // Now we again use Gaussian Sum on the number of remaining days
  result += (days * (days + 1)) / 2 + weeks * days;

  return result;
};
```

| --------------- | ---------------- |
| O(1)            | O(1)             |

```js
// Approach 2: Using Gaussian Sum, but still iterating through weeks
const totalMoney = function (n) {
  let result = 0;

  // Calculate how many full weeks there are
  const weeks = Math.floor(n / 7);

  // As well as the remaining days after those weeks
  const days = n % 7;

  // Keep track of how much money we begin with each week;
  // This will increment each new week
  let startingAmount = 1;

  for (let i = 0; i < weeks; i++) {
    // Each week, the sum is a simplified Gaussian Sum from startingAmount to startingAmount + 7
    result += (3 + startingAmount) * 7;

    // Starting amount increases at the start of each week
    startingAmount++;
  }

  // Now we again use Gaussian Sum on the number of remaining days
  // We add weeks * days to account for the starting value not being 0,
  // but rather the appropriate amount after adding 1 additional each week
  result += (days * (days + 1)) / 2 + weeks * days;

  return result;
};
```

```js
// Approach 1: Brute-Force simulating the process
const totalMoney = function (n) {
  let result = 0;
  const weeks = Math.floor(n / 7);
  const days = n % 7;
  let startingAmount = 1;

  for (let i = 0; i < weeks; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < 7; j++) {
      result += startingAmount + j;
    }
    startingAmount++;
  }

  for (let i = 0; i < days; i++) {
    result += startingAmount + i;
  }

  return result;
};
```
