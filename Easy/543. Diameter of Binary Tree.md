# [543. Diameter of Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-of-binary-tree)

## Description

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return _the length of the **diameter** of the tree_.

The **diameter** of a binary tree is the **length** of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the `root`.

The **length** of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/06/diamtree.jpg)

**Input:** root = [1,2,3,4,5]  
**Output:** 3  
**Explanation:** 3 is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].

**Example 2:**

**Input:** root = [1,2]  
**Output:** 1

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 10^4]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
var diameterOfBinaryTree = function (root) {
  // Keep track of the max diameter found
  let result = 0;

  // Returns the height of a tree
  // While also altering result to store the largest diameter
  const maxDepth = (node) => {
    // A null node does not contribute to height
    if (!node) return 0;

    // Calculate the heights of each child node
    const leftHeight = maxDepth(node.left);
    const rightHeight = maxDepth(node.right);

    // Diameter is the sum of the two heights
    result = Math.max(result, leftHeight + rightHeight);

    // Return the actual height
    return 1 + Math.max(leftHeight, rightHeight);
  };

  // Begin our recursion through the tree, which will
  // be modifying our result variable accordingly
  maxDepth(root);

  return result;
};
```
