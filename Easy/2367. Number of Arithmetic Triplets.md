# [2367. Number of Arithmetic Triplets](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-arithmetic-triplets)

## Description

You are given a **0-indexed**, **strictly increasing** integer array `nums` and a positive integer `diff`. A triplet `(i, j, k)` is an **arithmetic triplet** if the following conditions are met:

- `i < j < k`,
- `nums[j] - nums[i] == diff`, and
- `nums[k] - nums[j] == diff`.

Return _the number of unique **arithmetic triplets**._

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[0,1,4,6,7,10\], diff = 3  
**Output:** 2  
**Explanation:**  
(1, 2, 4) is an arithmetic triplet because both 7 - 4 == 3 and 4 - 1 == 3.  
(2, 4, 5) is an arithmetic triplet because both 10 - 7 == 3 and 7 - 4 == 3.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[4,5,6,7,8,9\], diff = 2  
**Output:** 2  
**Explanation:**  
(0, 2, 4) is an arithmetic triplet because both 8 - 6 == 2 and 6 - 4 == 2.  
(1, 3, 5) is an arithmetic triplet because both 9 - 7 == 2 and 7 - 5 == 2.

**Constraints:**

- `3 <= nums.length <= 200`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 200`
- `1 <= diff <= 50`
- `nums` is **strictly** increasing.

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
const arithmeticTriplets = (nums, diff) => {
  let result = 0;
  const map = {};

  for (let num of nums) {
    map[num] = true;
  }

  for (let num of nums) {
    // For each number, treat it as j. That is, treat it as the middle number.
    // See if i (j - diff) and k (j + diff) exist in the map
    if (map[num - diff] && map[num + diff]) ++result;
  }

  return result;
};
```

| Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
| --------------- | ---------------- |
| O(N)            | O(N)             |

```js
const arithmeticTriplets = (nums, diff) => {
  let result = 0;

  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; ++i) {
    for (let j = i + 1; j < nums.length; ++j) {
      for (let k = j + 1; k < nums.length; ++k) {
        const a = nums[i];
        const b = nums[j];
        const c = nums[k];
        if (c - b === diff && b - a === diff) ++result;
      }
    }
  }

  return result;
};
```
