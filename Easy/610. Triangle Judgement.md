# [610. Triangle Judgement](https://leetcode.com/problems/triangle-judgement)

## Description

Table: `Triangle`

```
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| x           | int  |
| y           | int  |
| z           | int  |
+-------------+------+
```

In SQL, (x, y, z) is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table contains the lengths of three line segments.

Report for every three line segments whether they can form a triangle.

Return the result table in **any order**.

TheÂ result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

**Input:**
Triangle table:

```
+----+----+----+
| x  | y  | z  |
+----+----+----+
| 13 | 15 | 30 |
| 10 | 20 | 15 |
+----+----+----+
```

**Output:**

```
+----+----+----+----------+
| x  | y  | z  | triangle |
+----+----+----+----------+
| 13 | 15 | 30 | No       |
| 10 | 20 | 15 | Yes      |
+----+----+----+----------+
```

## My Solution

**MySQL**

```sql
-- We can form a valid triangle if the sum of two sides is greater than the third side.
-- This must hold true for all 3 possible combinations of sides
SELECT *, IF(x + y > z and y + z > x and z + x > y, "Yes", "No") AS triangle
FROM Triangle
```
