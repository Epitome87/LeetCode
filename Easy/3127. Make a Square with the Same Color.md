# [3127. Make a Square with the Same Color](https://leetcode.com/problems/make-a-square-with-the-same-color)

## Description

You are given a 2D matrix `grid` of size `3 x 3` consisting only of characters `'B'` and `'W'`. Character `'W'` represents the white color, and character `'B'` represents the black color.

Your task is to change the color of **at most one** cell so that the matrix has a `2 x 2` square where all cells are of the same color.

Return `true` if it is possible to create a `2 x 2` square of the same color, otherwise, return `false`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** grid = \[\["B","W","B"\],\["B","W","W"\],\["B","W","B"\]\]  
**Output:** true  
**Explanation:**  
It can be done by changing the color of the `grid[0][2]`.

**Example 2:**  
**Input:** grid = \[\["B","W","B"\],\["W","B","W"\],\["B","W","B"\]\]  
**Output:** false  
**Explanation:**  
It cannot be done by changing at most one cell.

**Example 3:**  
**Input:** grid = \[\["B","W","B"\],\["B","W","W"\],\["B","W","W"\]\]  
**Output:** true  
**Explanation:**  
The `grid` already contains a `2 x 2` square of the same color.

**Constraints:**

- `grid.length == 3`
- `grid[i].length == 3`
- `grid[i][j]` is either `'W'` or `'B'`.

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
// Approach: Brute-Force
// See if any (4, in this case) of the 2x2 grids contain 3+ of same color
const canMakeSquare = (grid) => {
  for (let r = 0; r < grid.length - 1; ++r) {
    for (let c = 0; c < grid.length - 1; ++c) {
      if (isPossible(grid, r, c)) return true;
    }
  }

  return false;
};

const isPossible = (grid, row, col) => {
  let blackCount = 0;
  let whiteCount = 0;

  for (let r = row; r < row + 2; ++r) {
    for (let c = col; c < col + 2; ++c) {
      if (grid[r][c] === 'B') ++blackCount;
      else ++whiteCount;
    }
  }

  return blackCount >= 3 || whiteCount >= 3;
};
```
