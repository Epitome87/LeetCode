# [1221. Split a String in Balanced Strings](https://leetcode.com/problems/split-a-string-in-balanced-strings)

## Description

**Balanced** strings are those that have an equal quantity of `'L'` and `'R'` characters.

Given a **balanced** string `s`, split it into some number of substrings such that:

- Each substring is balanced.

Return _the **maximum** number of balanced strings you can obtain._

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "RLRRLLRLRL"  
**Output:** 4  
**Explanation:** s can be split into "RL", "RRLL", "RL", "RL", each substring contains same number of 'L' and 'R'.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "RLRRRLLRLL"  
**Output:** 2  
**Explanation:** s can be split into "RL", "RRRLLRLL", each substring contains same number of 'L' and 'R'.  
Note that s cannot be split into "RL", "RR", "RL", "LR", "LL", because the 2nd and 5th substrings are not balanced.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s = "LLLLRRRR"  
**Output:** 1  
**Explanation:** s can be split into "LLLLRRRR".

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= s.length <= 1000`
- `s[i]` is either `'L'` or `'R'`.
- `s` is a **balanced** string.

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
// Approach: Every time we encounter an equal number of L and R,
// we increment our result by 1.
const balancedStringSplit = function (s) {
  let result = 0;
  let count = 0;

  for (let char of s) {
    if (char === 'L') count--;
    else count++;
    if (count === 0) result++;
  }

  return result;
};
```

| Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
| --------------- | ---------------- |
| O(N)            | O(1)             |

**Python**

```python
def balancedStringSplit(s: str) -> int:
    result = 0
    count = 0

    for char in s:
        if char == 'L': count -= 1
        else: count += 1
        if count == 0: result += 1

    return result
```

| Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
| --------------- | ---------------- |
| O(N)            | O(1)             |
