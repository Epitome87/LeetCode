# [1710. Maximum Units on a Truck](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-units-on-a-truck)

## Description

You are assigned to put some amount of boxes onto **one truck**. You are given a 2D array `boxTypes`, where `boxTypes[i] = [numberOfBoxesi, numberOfUnitsPerBoxi]`:

- `numberOfBoxesi` is the number of boxes of type `i`.
- `numberOfUnitsPerBoxi` is the number of units in each box of the type `i`.

You are also given an integer `truckSize`, which is the **maximum** number of **boxes** that can be put on the truck. You can choose any boxes to put on the truck as long as the numberÂ of boxes does not exceed `truckSize`.

Return _the **maximum** total number of **units** that can be put on the truck._

**Example 1:**

**Input:** boxTypes = \[\[1,3\],\[2,2\],\[3,1\]\], truckSize = 4  
**Output:** 8  
**Explanation:** There are:

- 1 box of the first type that contains 3 units.
- 2 boxes of the second type that contain 2 units each.
- 3 boxes of the third type that contain 1 unit each.  
  You can take all the boxes of the first and second types, and one box of the third type.  
  The total number of units will be = (1 \* 3) + (2 \* 2) + (1 \* 1) = 8.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** boxTypes = \[\[5,10\],\[2,5\],\[4,7\],\[3,9\]\], truckSize = 10  
**Output:** 91

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= boxTypes.length <= 1000`
- `1 <= numberOfBoxesi, numberOfUnitsPerBoxi <= 1000`
- `1 <= truckSize <= 10^6`

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
// Approach: Counting Sort
const maximumUnits = (boxTypes, truckSize) => {
  let count = new Array(1001).fill(0);
  for (let [numBox, numUnits] of boxTypes) count[numUnits] += numBox;

  let units = 0;
  for (let i = 1000; i >= 0; --i) {
    // Not all these boxes will fit; only put in those that will
    if (count[i] > truckSize) return units + truckSize * i;

    // Put all boxes with a count of i units into the truck
    truckSize -= count[i];
    units += count[i] * i;
  }

  return units;
};
```

```js
// Approach: Greedily prefer boxes that contain the largest amount of units
const maximumUnits = (boxTypes, truckSize) => {
  // Sort boxes by their number of units, descending
  const sortedBoxes = boxTypes.toSorted((a, b) => b[1] - a[1]);

  // The amount of total units and boxes we place onto the truck
  let totalNumUnits = 0;
  let totalNumBoxes = 0;

  for (let [numBoxes, numUnitsPerBox] of sortedBoxes) {
    // If truck has room for ALL boxes of this type, put them all in
    if (truckSize >= numBoxes) {
      totalNumUnits += numBoxes * numUnitsPerBox;
      truckSize -= numBoxes;
    } else {
      // Otherwise just put in however much can fit
      return totalNumUnits + truckSize * numUnitsPerBox;
    }
  }

  return totalNumUnits;
};
```

```js
// Approach: Greedily prefer boxes that contain the largest amount of units
const maximumUnits = (boxTypes, truckSize) => {
  // Sort boxes by their number of units, descending
  const sortedBoxes = boxTypes.toSorted((a, b) => b[1] - a[1]);

  // The amount of total units and boxes we place onto the truck
  let totalNumUnits = 0;
  let totalNumBoxes = 0;

  for (let [numBoxes, numUnitsPerBox] of sortedBoxes) {
    for (let count = 0; count < numBoxes; ++count) {
      // Increase total units by the amount in this box
      totalNumUnits += numUnitsPerBox;

      // Increment the number of boxes placed into the truck by 1
      ++totalNumBoxes;

      // Return early if we've fully loaded the truck
      if (totalNumBoxes === truckSize) return totalNumUnits;
    }
  }

  return totalNumUnits;
};
