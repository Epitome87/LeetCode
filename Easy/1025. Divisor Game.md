# [1025. Divisor Game](https://leetcode.com/problems/divisor-game)

## Description

Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with Alice starting first.

Initially, there is a number `n` on the chalkboard. On each player's turn, that player makes a move consisting of:

- Choosing any `x` with `0 < x < n` and `n % x == 0`.
- Replacing the number `n` on the chalkboard with `n - x`.

Also, if a player cannot make a move, they lose the game.

Return `true` _if and only if Alice wins the game, assuming both players play optimally_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 2  
**Output:** true  
**Explanation:** Alice chooses 1, and Bob has no more moves.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 3  
**Output:** false  
**Explanation:** Alice chooses 1, Bob chooses 1, and Alice has no more moves.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 1000`

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
/*
If n is initially even:
1. Alice's optimal strategy is to choose x = 1. This leaves n as n - 1 (odd), which we send to Bob.
2. Bob's optimal strategy is to choose x as largest as possible to make n reduce as fast as possible,
as there is no way he can win once an even number arrives to Alice.
if n is initially odd:
1. The situation is basically reversed; Alice is the one in panic mode, and there is no way to send 
an odd back to Bob. His next number will be even, which he will play optimally by choosing 1.

const divisorGame = (n) => n % 2 === 0;
