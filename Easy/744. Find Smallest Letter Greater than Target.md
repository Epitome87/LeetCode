# [744. Find Smallest Letter Greater than Target](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-smallest-letter-greater-than-target)

## Description

You are given an array of characters `letters` that is sorted in **non-decreasing order**, and a character `target`. There are **at least two different** characters in `letters`.

Return _the smallest character in_ `letters` _that is lexicographically greater than_ `target`. If such a character does not exist, return the first character in `letters`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** letters = \["c","f","j"\], target = "a"  
**Output:** "c"  
**Explanation:** The smallest character that is lexicographically greater than 'a' in letters is 'c'.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** letters = \["c","f","j"\], target = "c"  
**Output:** "f"  
**Explanation:** The smallest character that is lexicographically greater than 'c' in letters is 'f'.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** letters = \["x","x","y","y"\], target = "z"  
**Output:** "x"  
**Explanation:** There are no characters in letters that is lexicographically greater than 'z' so we return letters\[0\].

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= letters.length <= 104`
- `letters[i]` is a lowercase English letter.
- `letters` is sorted in **non-decreasing** order.
- `letters` contains at least two different characters.
- `target` is a lowercase English letter.

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
const nextGreatestLetter = (letters, target) => {
  if (target >= letters.at(-1) || target < letters[0]) {
    return letters[0];
  }

  let left = 0;
  let right = letters.length - 1;

  while (left <= right) {
    const mid = left + Math.floor((right - left) / 2);
    if (target >= letters[mid]) left = mid + 1;
    else if (letters[mid] > target) right = mid - 1;
  }

  return letters[left];
};
```

| --------------- | ---------------- |
| O(Log(N))       | O(1)             |

```js
const nextGreatestLetter = (letters, target) => letters.find((v) => v > target) || letters[0];
```
