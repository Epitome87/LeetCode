# [Shortest Completing Word](https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-completing-word)

## Description

Given a string `licensePlate` and an array of strings `words`, find the **shortest completing** word in `words`.

A **completing** word is a word that **contains all the letters** in `licensePlate`. **Ignore numbers and spaces** in `licensePlate`, and treat letters as **case insensitive**. If a letter appears more than once in `licensePlate`, then it must appear in the word the same number of times or more.

For example, if `licensePlate` `= "aBc 12c"`, then it contains letters `'a'`, `'b'` (ignoring case), and `'c'` twice. Possible **completing** words are `"abccdef"`, `"caaacab"`, and `"cbca"`.

Return _the shortest **completing** word in_ `words`_._ It is guaranteed an answer exists. If there are multiple shortest **completing** words, return the **first** one that occurs in `words`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** licensePlate = "1s3 PSt", words = \["step","steps","stripe","stepple"\]
**Output:** "steps"
**Explanation:** licensePlate contains letters 's', 'p', 's' (ignoring case), and 't'.
"step" contains 't' and 'p', but only contains 1 's'.
"steps" contains 't', 'p', and both 's' characters.
"stripe" is missing an 's'.
"stepple" is missing an 's'.
Since "steps" is the only word containing all the letters, that is the answer.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** licensePlate = "1s3 456", words = \["looks","pest","stew","show"\]
**Output:** "pest"
**Explanation:** licensePlate only contains the letter 's'. All the words contain 's', but among these "pest", "stew", and "show" are shortest. The answer is "pest" because it is the word that appears earliest of the 3.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= licensePlate.length <= 7`
- `licensePlate` contains digits, letters (uppercase or lowercase), or space `' '`.
- `1 <= words.length <= 1000`
- `1 <= words[i].length <= 15`
- `words[i]` consists of lower case English letters.

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
const shortestCompletingWord = function (licensePlate, words) {
  const match = { found: false, word: '' };
  const licenseChars = [...licensePlate.toLowerCase().replace(/[^a-z]/g, '')];

  for (let word of words) {
    // Process this word if we have no matches yet
    // Also process if there is a match but this word serves as a potentially shorter match
    if (!match.found || word.length < match.word.length) {
      let replaceWord = word.toLowerCase();

      // Remove each char from this word as we encounter it in licenseChars
      for (let char of licenseChars) {
        replaceWord = replaceWord.replace(char, '');
      }

      // At this point, our word has had all the chars from licenseChars removed from it.
      // We know it's a 'completing word' if its original length minus the licenseChars length
      // is equal to the length of the replaced word
      if (word.length - licenseChars.length === replaceWord.length) {
        match.found = true;
        match.word = word;
      }
    }
  }

  return match.word;
};
```

```js
const shortestCompletingWord = function (licensePlate, words) {
  const candidates = [];
  const counts = [...licensePlate.toLowerCase()].reduce((acc, cur) => {
    if (/[a-z]/i.test(cur)) acc[cur] = acc[cur] + 1 || 1;
    return acc;
  }, {});

  for (let word of words) {
    const wordCounts = [...word.toLowerCase()].reduce((acc, cur) => ((acc[cur] = acc[cur] + 1 || 1), acc), {});
    if (Object.keys(counts).every((key) => wordCounts[key] >= counts[key])) candidates.push(word);
  }

  let shortestWord = null;
  let shortestLength = Infinity;

  for (let candidate of candidates) {
    if (candidate.length < shortestLength) {
      shortestWord = candidate;
      shortestLength = candidate.length;
    }
  }

  return shortestWord;
};
```

**Python**

```py
class Solution:
    def shortestCompletingWord(self, licensePlate: str, words: List[str]) -> str:
        d = Counter(x for x in licensePlate.lower() if x.isalpha())
        return min([w for w in words if not d - Counter(w)], key = len)
```
