# [205. Isomorphic Strings](https://leetcode.com/problems/isomorphic-strings)

## Description

Given two strings `s` and `t`, _determine if they are isomorphic_.

Two strings `s` and `t` are isomorphic if the characters in `s` can be replaced to get `t`.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself.

**Example 1:**
**Input:** s = "egg", t = "add"  
**Output:** true  
**Explanation:**  
The strings `s` and `t` can be made identical by:

- Mapping `'e'` to `'a'`.
- Mapping `'g'` to `'d'`.

**Example 2:**  
**Input:** s = "foo", t = "bar"  
**Output:** false  
**Explanation:**  
The strings `s` and `t` can not be made identical as `'o'` needs to be mapped to both `'a'` and `'r'`.

**Example 3:**  
**Input:** s = "paper", t = "title"  
**Output:** true

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 5 * 10^4`
- `t.length == s.length`
- `s` and `t` consist of any valid ascii character.

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

Approach: Use TWO hashmaps
We note that for s to be isomorphic with t, t must also be isomorphic with s.
This essentially avoids having to check if a character is already a value in
the hashmap for our other approach, which can be an expensive operation.

```js
const isIsomorphic = (s, t) => {
  // Map characters in S to characters of T
  const mapST = {};

  // Map characters in T to characters in S
  const mapTS = {};

  for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
    const charS = s[i];
    const charT = t[i];

    // If these characters have already been mapped previously,
    // and this new char is not the same as that mapping, return false
    if (charS in mapST && mapST[charS] !== charT) return false;
    if (charT in mapTS && mapTS[charT] !== charS) return false;

    // Map the current characters to their respective keys
    mapST[charS] = charT;
    mapTS[charT] = charS;
  }

  // No invalid mappings were found, so we must be isomorphic
  return true;
};
```

```js
const isIsomorphic = (s, t) => {
  const map = {};

  for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
    const charS = s[i];
    const charT = t[i];

    // Have we already mapped character S before?
    if (charS in map) {
      // That's fine -- as long as character T matches its original mapping to
      if (map[charS] !== charT) return false;
    } else {
      // Character S has not been mapped yet
      // Has charT already been mapped to something else?
      // This would not make it isomorphic
      if (Object.values(map).includes(charT)) return false;

      // Map character S to character T
      map[charS] = charT;
    }
  }

  return true;
};
```
