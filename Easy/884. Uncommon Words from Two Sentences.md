# [884. Uncommon Words from Two Sentences](https://leetcode.com/problems/uncommon-words-from-two-sentences)

## Description

A **sentence** is a string of single-space separated words where each word consists only of lowercase letters.

A word is **uncommon** if it appears exactly once in one of the sentences, and **does not appear** in the other sentence.

Given two **sentences** `s1` and `s2`, return _a list of all the **uncommon words**_. You may return the answer in **any order**.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s1 = "this apple is sweet", s2 = "this apple is sour"  
**Output:** \["sweet","sour"\]  
**Explanation:**

The word `"sweet"` appears only in `s1`, while the word `"sour"` appears only in `s2`.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s1 = "apple apple", s2 = "banana"  
**Output:** \["banana"\]

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s1.length, s2.length <= 200`
- `s1` and `s2` consist of lowercase English letters and spaces.
- `s1` and `s2` do not have leading or trailing spaces.
- All the words in `s1` and `s2` are separated by a single space.

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
// Approach: Count frequencies of each word. We can note that an uncommon word will simply
// have a frequency of 1; no need to check if it occurred in one word and note the other.
const uncommonFromSentences = (s1, s2) => {
  const map1 = (s1 + ' ' + s2).split(' ').reduce((acc, cur) => ((acc[cur] = acc[cur] + 1 || 1), acc), {});
  return Object.keys(map1).filter((word) => map1[word] === 1);
};
```

```js
// Approach: Brute-Force
// Count the frequency of words in each sentence separately. Then iterate through each frequency
// map separately and see if the value is 1 while also being absent (undefined) in the other map.
const uncommonFromSentences = (s1, s2) => {
  const result = [];
  const map1 = s1.split(' ').reduce((acc, cur) => ((acc[cur] = acc[cur] + 1 || 1), acc), {});
  const map2 = s2.split(' ').reduce((acc, cur) => ((acc[cur] = acc[cur] + 1 || 1), acc), {});

  for (let word in map1) {
    if (map1[word] === 1 && !map2[word]) {
      result.push(word);
    }
  }

  for (let word in map2) {
    if (map2[word] === 1 && !map1[word]) {
      result.push(word);
    }
  }

  return result;
};
```
