# [3248. Snake in Matrix](https://leetcode.com/problems/snake-in-matrix)

## Description

There is a snake in an `n x n` matrix `grid` and can move in **four possible directions**. Each cell in the `grid` is identified by the position: `grid[i][j] = (i * n) + j`.

The snake starts at cell 0 and follows a sequence of commands.

You are given an integer `n` representing the size of the `grid` and an array of strings `commands` where each `command[i]` is either `"UP"`, `"RIGHT"`, `"DOWN"`, and `"LEFT"`. It's guaranteed that the snake will remain within the `grid` boundaries throughout its movement.

Return the position of the final cell where the snake ends up after executing `commands`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 2, commands = \["RIGHT","DOWN"\]  
**Output:** 3

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 3, commands = \["DOWN","RIGHT","UP"\]  
**Output:** 1

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= n <= 10`
- `1 <= commands.length <= 100`
- `commands` consists only of `"UP"`, `"RIGHT"`, `"DOWN"`, and `"LEFT"`.
- The input is generated such the snake will not move outside of the boundaries.

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
const finalPositionOfSnake = (n, commands) => {
  const directions = { UP: [-1, 0], DOWN: [1, 0], LEFT: [0, -1], RIGHT: [0, 1] };
  let curRow = 0;
  let curCol = 0;

  for (let command of commands) {
    const [rowDelta, colDelta] = directions[command];
    curRow += rowDelta;
    curCol += colDelta;
  }

  return curRow * n + curCol;
};
```

```js
const finalPositionOfSnake = (n, commands) => {
  let curRow = 0;
  let curCol = 0;

  for (let command of commands) {
    switch (command) {
      case 'UP':
        curRow--;
        break;
      case 'DOWN':
        curRow++;
        break;
      case 'LEFT':
        curCol--;
        break;
      case 'RIGHT':
        curCol++;
        break;
    }
  }

  return curRow * n + curCol;
};
```
