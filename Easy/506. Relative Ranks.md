# [Relative Ranks](https://leetcode.com/problems/relative-ranks)

## Description

ou are given an integer array `score` of size `n`, where `score[i]` is the score of the `ith` athlete in a competition. All the scores are guaranteed to be **unique**.

The athletes are **placed** based on their scores, where the `1st` place athlete has the highest score, the `2nd` place athlete has the `2nd` highest score, and so on. The placement of each athlete determines their rank:

- The `1st` place athlete's rank is `"Gold Medal"`.
- The `2nd` place athlete's rank is `"Silver Medal"`.
- The `3rd` place athlete's rank is `"Bronze Medal"`.
- For the `4th` place to the `nth` place athlete, their rank is their placement number (i.e., the `xth` place athlete's rank is `"x"`).

Return an array `answer` of size `n` where `answer[i]` is the **rank** of the `ith` athlete.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** score = \[5,4,3,2,1\]  
**Output:** \["Gold Medal","Silver Medal","Bronze Medal","4","5"\]  
**Explanation:** The placements are \[1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th\].

**Example 2:**

**Input:** score = \[10,3,8,9,4\]  
**Output:** \["Gold Medal","5","Bronze Medal","Silver Medal","4"\]  
**Explanation:** The placements are \[1st, 5th, 3rd, 2nd, 4th\].

**Constraints:**

- `n == score.length`
- `1 <= n <= 10^4`
- `0 <= score[i] <= 10^6`
- All the values in `score` are **unique**.

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
var findRelativeRanks = function (score) {
  const result = new Array(score.length);
  const scoreWithIdx = score.map((score, idx) => [score, idx]);

  scoreWithIdx.sort((a, b) => b[0] - a[0]);
  const rank = ['Gold Medal', 'Silver Medal', 'Bronze Medal'];

  for (let i = 0; i < score.length; i++) {
    const index = scoreWithIdx[i][1];
    result[index] = rank[i] || `${i + 1}`;
  }

  return result;
};
```
