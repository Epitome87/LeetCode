# [1046. Last Stone Weight](https://leetcode.com/problems/last-stone-weight)

## Description

You are given an array of integers `stones` where `stones[i]` is the weight of the `ith` stone.

We are playing a game with the stones. On each turn, we choose the **heaviest two stones** and smash them together. Suppose the heaviest two stones have weights `x` and `y` with `x <= y`. The result of this smash is:

- If `x == y`, both stones are destroyed, and
- If `x != y`, the stone of weight `x` is destroyed, and the stone of weight `y` has new weight `y - x`.

At the end of the game, there is **at most one** stone left.

Return _the weight of the last remaining stone_. If there are no stones left, return `0`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** stones = \[2,7,4,1,8,1\]  
**Output:** 1  
**Explanation:**  
We combine 7 and 8 to get 1 so the array converts to \[2,4,1,1,1\] then,  
we combine 2 and 4 to get 2 so the array converts to \[2,1,1,1\] then,  
we combine 2 and 1 to get 1 so the array converts to \[1,1,1\] then,  
we combine 1 and 1 to get 0 so the array converts to \[1\] then that's the value of the last stone.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** stones = \[1\]  
**Output:** 1

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= stones.length <= 30`
- `1 <= stones[i] <= 1000`

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
// Approach: Using the MaxPriorityQueue provided by LeetCode
const lastStoneWeight = (stones) => {
  let maxHeap = new MaxPriorityQueue();
  for (const stone of stones) maxHeap.enqueue(stone);

  while (maxHeap.size() > 1) {
    const diff = maxHeap.dequeue() - maxHeap.dequeue();
    if (diff > 0) maxHeap.enqueue(diff);
  }

  // Return the remaining stone, or 0 if there is none
  return maxHeap.front() ?? 0;
};
```

| Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
| --------------- | ---------------- |
| O(N \* Log(N))  | O(N)             |

```js
const lastStoneWeight = (stones) => {
  // We avoid mutating the input array
  const sortedStones = [...stones];

  while (sortedStones.length > 1) {
    sortedStones.sort((a, b) => a - b);

    // Pop the two heaviest stones, calculating their difference in weight
    const diff = sortedStones.pop() - sortedStones.pop();

    // If there is a difference, it forms a new rock
    if (diff > 0) sortedStones.push(diff);
  }

  // Return the remaining stone, or 0 if there is none
  return sortedStones[0] ?? 0;
};
```

| Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
| --------------- | ---------------- |
| O(N^2)          | O(N)             |

```js
// Approach: Brute-Force by simulating the process
const lastStoneWeight = (stones) => {
  const sortedStones = stones.toSorted((a, b) => b - a);

  while (sortedStones.length > 1) {
    // Grab the two biggest stones, ensuring x <= y
    const y = sortedStones[0];
    const x = sortedStones[1];

    if (x === y) {
      // If weights are equal, destroy both stones
      sortedStones.splice(0, 2);
    } else {
      // Otherwise, destroy the smaller stone and update
      // the bigger stone's weight to be their difference
      sortedStones.splice(0, 1);
      sortedStones[0] = y - x;
    }

    // Re-sort the list, as the left-most stone may no longer
    // be the largest after it was smashed
    sortedStones.sort((a, b) => b - a);
  }

  // Return the remaining stone, or 0 if there is none
  return sortedStones[0] ?? 0;
};

**Python**

```python
# Approach: Use Python's built-in heap to retrieve max values in O(1) time
def lastStoneWeight(self, stones: List[int]) -> int:
    # Negate all weight values, as we need a max heap (Python's is a min)
    heap = [-x for x in stones]

    # Turn stones list into a heap
    heapify(heap)

    while stones:
        # Pop the heaviest (or tied with heaviest) stone
        stone1 = -heappop(heap)

        # If stones is now empty, stone1 was the final stone
        if not heap: return stone1

        # Pop the 2nd heaviest stone from the heap
        stone2 = -heappop(heap)

        # If the stones were not equal in weight...
        if stone1 > stone2:
            # A new stone is formed with the difference of weights
            heappush(heap, stone2 - stone1)

    # If we reach here, no more stones are left
    return 0
```

**Java**

```java
public int lastStoneWeight(int[] stones) {
    PriorityQueue<Integer> heap = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> b - a);
    for (int stone : stones) heap.add(stone);

    while (heap.size() > 1) {
        // Retrieve the largest two stones
        int stone1 = heap.poll();
        int stone2 = heap.poll();

        // If stones were not equal, a new one is formed with their difference
        if (stone1 > stone2) heap.add(stone1 - stone2);
    }

    // Were we left with a stone?
    if (heap.size() != 0) return heap.poll();

    // Return 0 if no stones were remaining
    return 0;
}
```
