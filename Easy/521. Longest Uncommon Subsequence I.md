# [521. Longest Uncommon Subsequence I](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-uncommon-subsequence-i)

## Description

Given two strings `a` and `b`, return _the length of the **longest uncommon subsequence** between_ `a` _and_ `b`. _If no such uncommon subsequence exists, return_ `-1`_._

An **uncommon subsequence** between two strings is a string that is a **subsequence of exactly one of them**. (A _subsequence_ is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.)

**Example 1:**

**Input:** a = "aba", b = "cdc"  
**Output:** 3  
**Explanation:** One longest uncommon subsequence is "aba" because "aba" is a subsequence of "aba" but not "cdc".  
Note that "cdc" is also a longest uncommon subsequence.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** a = "aaa", b = "bbb"  
**Output:** 3  
**Explanation:** The longest uncommon subsequences are "aaa" and "bbb".

**Example 3:**

**Input:** a = "aaa", b = "aaa"  
**Output:** -1  
**Explanation:** Every subsequence of string a is also a subsequence of string b. Similarly, every subsequence of string b is also a subsequence of string a. So the answer would be `-1`.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= a.length, b.length <= 100`
- `a` and `b` consist of lower-case English letters.

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
const findLUSlength = (a, b) => (a === b ? -1 : Math.max(a.length, b.length));
```

| Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
| --------------- | ---------------- |
| O(1)            | O(1)             |

**Python**

```python
def findLUSlength(self, a: str, b: str) -> int:
    return -1 if a == b else max(len(a), len(b))
```

| Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
| --------------- | ---------------- |
| O(1)            | O(1)             |

**Java**

```java
public int findLUSlength(String a, String b) {
    if (a.equals(b)) return -1;
    return Math.max(a.length(), b.length());
}
```

| O(1)            | O(1)             |
