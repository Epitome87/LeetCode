# [1356. Sort Integers by the Number of 1 Bits](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-integers-by-the-number-of-1-bits)

## Description

You are given an integer array `arr`. Sort the integers in the array in ascending order by the number of `1`'s in their binary representation and in case of two or more integers have the same number of `1`'s you have to sort them in ascending order.

Return _the array after sorting it_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** arr = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]  
**Output:** [0,1,2,4,8,3,5,6,7]  
**Explantion:** [0] is the only integer with 0 bits.  
[1,2,4,8] all have 1 bit.  
[3,5,6] have 2 bits.  
[7] has 3 bits.  
The sorted array by bits is [0,1,2,4,8,3,5,6,7]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** arr = [1024,512,256,128,64,32,16,8,4,2,1]  
**Output:** [1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128,256,512,1024]  
**Explantion:** All integers have 1 bit in the binary representation, you should just sort them in ascending order.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= arr.length <= 500`
- `0 <= arr[i] <= 10^4`

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
const sortByBits = (arr) => arr.sort((a, b) => numOneBits(a) - numOneBits(b) || a - b);

// Using Brian Kernighan's Algorithm for counting 1 bits
const numOneBits = (n) => {
  let result = 0;

  while (n) {
    ++result;
    n = n & (n - 1);
  }

  return result;
};

// Using bit-shifting to count number of 1 bits
const numOneBits = (n) => {
  let result = 0;

  while (n) {
    result += n & 1;
    n = n >> 1;
  }

  return result;
};
```
