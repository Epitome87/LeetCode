# [3487. Maximum Unique Subarray Sum After Deletion](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-unique-subarray-sum-after-deletion)

## Description

You are given an integer array `nums`.

You are allowed to delete any number of elements from `nums` without making it **empty**. After performing the deletions, select a subarray of `nums` such that:

1.  All elements in the subarray are **unique**.
2.  The sum of the elements in the subarray is **maximized**.

Return the **maximum sum** of such a subarray.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,2,3,4,5\]  
**Output:** 15  
**Explanation:**  
Select the entire array without deleting any element to obtain the maximum sum.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,1,0,1,1\]  
**Output:** 1  
**Explanation:**  
Delete the element `nums[0] == 1`, `nums[1] == 1`, `nums[2] == 0`, and `nums[3] == 1`. Select the entire array `[1]` to obtain the maximum sum.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,2,-1,-2,1,0,-1\]  
**Output:** 3  
**Explanation:**  
Delete the elements `nums[2] == -1` and `nums[3] == -2`, and select the subarray `[2, 1]` from `[1, 2, 1, 0, -1]` to obtain the maximum sum.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
- `-100 <= nums[i] <= 100`

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
/*
We obviously wish to remove any negative number, as they do not help contribute to a max sum.
We also want to use as many positive numbers as possible, as each and every will contribute to a new max sum.
Since we are allowed to delete any number of elements we want (without making it empty), why not just delete all duplicates?
This allows us to consider all unique positive values as the full list of numbers to sum, rather than considering multiple subarrays. This is why we use a Set, discarding negative numbers from it.

If there were no positive numbers in the Set, we just return the largest negative.
*/
const maxSum = (nums) => {
  result = 0;
  const uniqueNums = new Set(nums);

  for (const num of uniqueNums) {
    if (num > 0) result += num;
  }

  return result ? result : Math.max(...nums);
};
```

```js
const maxSum = (nums) => {
  const uniquePositives = [...new Set(nums.filter((n) => n > 0))];
  if (uniquePositives.length === 0) return Math.max(...nums);
  return uniquePositives.reduce((acc, cur) => acc + cur, 0);
};
```
