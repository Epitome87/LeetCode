# [999. Available Captures for Rook](https://leetcode.com/problems/available-captures-for-rook)

## Description

You are given an `8 x 8` **matrix** representing a chessboard. There is **exactly one** white rook represented by `'R'`, some number of white bishops `'B'`, and some number of black pawns `'p'`. Empty squares are represented by `'.'`.

A rook can move any number of squares horizontally or vertically (up, down, left, right) until it reaches another piece _or_ the edge of the board. A rook is **attacking** a pawn if it can move to the pawn's square in one move.

Note: A rook cannot move through other pieces, such as bishops or pawns. This means a rook cannot attack a pawn if there is another piece blocking the path.

Return the **number of pawns** the white rook is **attacking**.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** board = \[\[".",".",".",".",".",".",".","."\],\[".",".",".","p",".",".",".","."\],\[".",".",".","R",".",".",".","p"\],\[".",".",".",".",".",".",".","."\],\[".",".",".",".",".",".",".","."\],\[".",".",".","p",".",".",".","."\],\[".",".",".",".",".",".",".","."\],\[".",".",".",".",".",".",".","."\]\]  
**Output:** 3  
**Explanation:**  
In this example, the rook is attacking all the pawns.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** board = \[\[".",".",".",".",".",".","."\],\[".","p","p","p","p","p",".","."\],\[".","p","p","B","p","p",".","."\],\[".","p","B","R","B","p",".","."\],\[".","p","p","B","p","p",".","."\],\[".","p","p","p","p","p",".","."\],\[".",".",".",".",".",".",".","."\],\[".",".",".",".",".",".",".","."\]\]  
**Output:** 0  
**Explanation:**  
The bishops are blocking the rook from attacking any of the pawns.

**Example 3:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/02/20/1253_example_3_improved.PNG)

**Input:** board = \[\[".",".",".",".",".",".",".","."\],\[".",".",".","p",".",".",".","."\],\[".",".",".","p",".",".",".","."\],\["p","p",".","R",".","p","B","."\],\[".",".",".",".",".",".",".","."\],\[".",".",".","B",".",".",".","."\],\[".",".",".","p",".",".",".","."\],\[".",".",".",".",".",".",".","."\]\]  
**Output:** 3  
**Explanation:**  
The rook is attacking the pawns at positions b5, d6, and f5.

**Constraints:**

- `board.length == 8`
- `board[i].length == 8`
- `board[i][j]` is either `'R'`, `'.'`, `'B'`, or `'p'`
- There is exactly one cell with `board[i][j] == 'R'`

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
const numRookCaptures = (board) => {
  let result = 0;

  // Locate the white rook
  for (let row = 0; row < 8; row++) {
    for (let col = 0; col < 8; col++) {
      if (board[row][col] === 'R') {
        rookRow = row;
        rookCol = col;
      }
    }
  }

  const directions = [
    [1, 0],
    [0, 1],
    [-1, 0],
    [0, -1],
  ];
  for (let [dirX, dirY] of directions) {
    let x = rookRow + dirX;
    let y = rookCol + dirY;

    while (x >= 0 && x < 8 && y >= 0 && y < 8) {
      if (board[x][y] === 'p') result++;
      if (board[x][y] !== '.') break;
      x += dirX;
      y += dirY;
    }
  }

  return result;
};
```

```js
const numRookCaptures = (board) => {
  let result = 0;

  // Locate the white rook
  for (let row = 0; row < 8; row++) {
    for (let col = 0; col < 8; col++) {
      if (board[row][col] === 'R') {
        rookRow = row;
        rookCol = col;
      }
    }
  }

  // Check vertical attacks
  for (let row = rookRow - 1; row >= 0; row--) {
    console.log('ROW', row);
    if (board[row][rookCol] === 'B') break;
    if (board[row][rookCol] === 'p') {
      result++;
      break;
    }
  }
  for (let row = rookRow + 1; row < 8; row++) {
    console.log('2nd ROW', row);
    if (board[row][rookCol] === 'B') break;
    if (board[row][rookCol] === 'p') {
      result++;
      break;
    }
  }

  // Check horizontal attacks
  for (let col = rookCol - 1; col >= 0; col--) {
    console.log('COL', col);
    if (board[rookRow][col] === 'B') break;
    if (board[rookRow][col] === 'p') {
      result++;
      break;
    }
  }
  for (let col = rookCol + 1; col < 8; col++) {
    console.log('2nd COL', col);
    if (board[rookRow][col] === 'B') break;
    if (board[rookRow][col] === 'p') {
      result++;
      break;
    }
  }

  return result;
};
```

**Python**

```py
def numRookCaptures(board: List[List[str]]) -> int:
    # Firstly, locate the position of the Rook
    rook_x = -1
    rook_y = -1

    for r in range(8):
        for c in range(8):
            if board[r][c] == 'R':
                rook_x, rook_y = r, c

    result = 0

    # Next, for each direction (N, E, S, W) starting from Rook's position...
    directions = [[0, -1], [0, 1], [-1, 0], [1, 0]]
    for x, y in directions:
        # Check the Rook's initial position + the offset based on current direction
        capture_x = rook_x + x
        capture_y = rook_y + y

        # Only check while the position we are checking is within the board boundaries
        while 0 <= capture_x < 8 and 0 <= capture_y < 8:
            # If we find a pawn, increment our result
            if board[capture_x][capture_y] == 'p':
                result += 1
            # We add this check AFTER the pawn check, so that in cases where a Pawn
            # is found, we still appropriately break (as this Pawn blocks other ones)
            if board[capture_x][capture_y] != '.':
                break

            # Don't forget to increment the direction offset!
            capture_x += x
            capture_y += y

    return result
```
