# [1952. Three Divisors](https://leetcode.com/problems/three-divisors)

## Description

Given an integer `n`, return `true` _if_ `n` _has **exactly three positive divisors**. Otherwise, return_ `false`.

An integer `m` is a **divisor** of `n` if there exists an integer `k` such that `n = k * m`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 2  
**Output:** false  
**Explanation:** 2 has only two divisors: 1 and 2.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 4  
**Output:** true  
**Explanation:** 4 has three divisors: 1, 2, and 4.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 10^4`

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
// n can only have 3 divisors (besides 1 and itself) if n is the square of a prime.
// Since max input is 10,000, the square root of 100 is the largest prime we need to work with.
const isThree = (n) => {
  const primes = new Set([
    2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97, 101,
  ]);
  return primes.has(Math.sqrt(n));
};
```

| O(1)            | O(1)             |

```js
// Approach: Note that every number has at least two divisors, 1 and itself.
// Also note that for every divisor (a) of n, n / a is also a divisor.
// In order for a number to have exactly 3 divisors, the 3rd divisor must be paired with itself.
// This means only perfect squares MIGHT meet the criteria, so we can return early if n isn't a square.
// Specifically, we return true if and only if n is the square of a prime number.
const isThree = (n) => {
  if (Math.sqrt(n) % 1) return false;

  let numDivisors = 0;

  for (let i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
    if (n % i === 0) ++numDivisors;
    if (numDivisors > 3) return false;
  }

  return numDivisors === 3;
};
```

```js
// Approach: Brute-Force
const isThree = (n) => {
  let numDivisors = 0;

  for (let i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
    if (n % i === 0) ++numDivisors;
    if (numDivisors > 3) return false;
  }

  return numDivisors === 3;
};
```
