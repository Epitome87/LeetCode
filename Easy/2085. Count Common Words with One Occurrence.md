# [2085. Count Common Words with One Occurrence](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-common-words-with-one-occurrence)

## Description

Given two string arrays `words1` and `words2`, return _the number of strings that appear **exactly once** in **each**Â of the two arrays._

**Example 1:**

**Input:** words1 = \["leetcode","is","amazing","as","is"\], words2 = \["amazing","leetcode","is"\]  
**Output:** 2  
**Explanation:**

- "leetcode" appears exactly once in each of the two arrays. We count this string.
- "amazing" appears exactly once in each of the two arrays. We count this string.
- "is" appears in each of the two arrays, but there are 2 occurrences of it in words1. We do not count this string.
- "as" appears once in words1, but does not appear in words2. We do not count this string.  
  Thus, there are 2 strings that appear exactly once in each of the two arrays.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** words1 = \["b","bb","bbb"\], words2 = \["a","aa","aaa"\]  
**Output:** 0  
**Explanation:** There are no strings that appear in each of the two arrays.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** words1 = \["a","ab"\], words2 = \["a","a","a","ab"\]  
**Output:** 1  
**Explanation:** The only string that appears exactly once in each of the two arrays is "ab".

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= words1.length, words2.length <= 1000`
- `1 <= words1[i].length, words2[j].length <= 30`
- `words1[i]` and `words2[j]` consists only of lowercase English letters.

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
const countWords = (words1, words2) => {
  let result = 0;
  const word1Count = [...words1].reduce((acc, cur) => ((acc[cur] = acc[cur] + 1 || 1), acc), {});
  const word2Count = [...words2].reduce((acc, cur) => ((acc[cur] = acc[cur] + 1 || 1), acc), {});

  for (let word of words1) {
    if (word1Count[word] === 1 && word2Count[word] === 1) {
      ++result;
    }
  }

  return result;
};
```
