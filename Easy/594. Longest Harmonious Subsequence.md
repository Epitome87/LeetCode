# [594. Longest Harmonious Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-harmonious-subsequence)

## Description

We define a harmonious array as an array where the difference between its maximum value and its minimum value is **exactly** `1`.

Given an integer array `nums`, return the length of its longest harmonious **subsequence** among all its possible subsequences.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [1,3,2,2,5,2,3,7]  
**Output:** 5  
**Explanation:**  
The longest harmonious subsequence is `[3,2,2,2,3]`.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [1,2,3,4]  
**Output:** 2  
**Explanation:**  
The longest harmonious subsequences are `[1,2]`, `[2,3]`, and `[3,4]`, all of which have a length of 2.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = [1,1,1,1]  
**Output:** 0  
**Explanation:**  
No harmonic subsequence exists.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 10^4`
- `-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

Approach: Sliding Window

```js
const findLHS = (nums) => {
  let result = 0;
  const sorted = nums.toSorted((a, b) => a - b);

  // We will use a Sliding Window, beginning with first and second elements
  let left = 0;
  let right = 1;

  while (right < sorted.length) {
    const delta = sorted[right] - sorted[left];

    // We aren't "harmonious" until we start having a delta of 1
    // At this point, we can begin updating our result
    if (delta === 1) result = Math.max(result, right - left + 1);

    // Once our delta is > 1, we must shrink our window
    if (delta > 1) left++;
    // If our delta is < 1, we can expand our window to find
    // if the next number adds to our candidate subsequence
    else right++;
  }

  return result;
};
```

| O(N \* LogN)    | O(1)             |

Approach: Hashmap for frequency counting.

Use a hashmap to keep track of how many times each number occurs.
We can then iterate through each key/value pairing and find out how
many times that value occurs, along with how many times a value one greater
than it occurs. This would form the "harmonious" subsequence.

```js
const findLHS = (nums) => {
  let result = 0;

  // Create a frequency counter for each number
  const map = nums.reduce((acc, cur) => ((acc[cur] = acc[cur] + 1 || 1), acc), {});

  for (let [key, val] of Object.entries(map)) {
    // The length of the subsequence is the number of current val + the
    // number of (val + 1)
    const selfCount = val;
    const adjacentCount = map[+key + 1] || 0;

    // If no adjacent numbers, we are not "harmonious" -- so count this as 0
    result = Math.max(result, adjacentCount ? selfCount + adjacentCount : 0);
  }

  return result;
};
```
