# [1758. Minimum Changes to Make Alternating Binary String](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-changes-to-make-alternating-binary-string)

## Description

You are given a string `s` consisting only of the characters `'0'` and `'1'`. In one operation, you can change any `'0'` to `'1'` or vice versa.

The string is called alternating if no two adjacent characters are equal. For example, the string `"010"` is alternating, while the string `"0100"` is not.

Return _the **minimum** number of operations needed to make_ `s` _alternating_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "0100"  
**Output:** 1  
**Explanation:** If you change the last character to '1', s will be "0101", which is alternating.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "10"  
**Output:** 0  
**Explanation:** s is already alternating.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s = "1111"  
**Output:** 2  
**Explanation:** You need two operations to reach "0101" or "1010".

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 10^4`
- `s[i]` is either `'0'` or `'1'`.

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
const minOperations = (s) => {
  let result = 0;

  // Count how many flips we need if we assume the first char should be a 0
  for (let i = 0; i < s.length; ++i) {
    result += s[i].charCodeAt() - '0'.charCodeAt() !== i % 2;
  }

  // Note that if we need to change result amount of characters to make a string starting with 0,
  // we need result - s.length to make a string starting with 1.
  return Math.min(result, s.length - result);
};
```
