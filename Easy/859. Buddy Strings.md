# [859. Buddy Strings](https://leetcode.com/problems/buddy-strings)

## Description

Given two strings `s` and `goal`, return `true` _if you can swap two letters in_ `s` _so the result is equal to_ `goal`_, otherwise, return_ `false`_._

Swapping letters is defined as taking two indices `i` and `j` (0-indexed) such that `i != j` and swapping the characters at `s[i]` and `s[j]`.

- For example, swapping at indices `0` and `2` in `"abcd"` results in `"cbad"`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "ab", goal = "ba"  
**Output:** true  
**Explanation:** You can swap s\[0\] = 'a' and s\[1\] = 'b' to get "ba", which is equal to goal.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "ab", goal = "ab"  
**Output:** false  
**Explanation:** The only letters you can swap are s\[0\] = 'a' and s\[1\] = 'b', which results in "ba" != goal.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s = "aa", goal = "aa"  
**Output:** true  
**Explanation:** You can swap s\[0\] = 'a' and s\[1\] = 'a' to get "aa", which is equal to goal.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length, goal.length <= 2 * 10^4`
- `s` and `goal` consist of lowercase letters.

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
const buddyStrings = (s, goal) => {
  // If they aren't the same length, there can't possibly be a valid swap
  if (s.length !== goal.length) return false;

  // If the two strings are the same, the only way they can remain equal after a swap
  // is if we are swapping duplicate characters. So check if we have any duplicates by
  // using a set
  if (s === goal && new Set(s).size < s.length) return true;

  // Find all the characters that differ in each string
  const difference = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
    if (s[i] !== goal[i]) difference.push(i);
  }

  // There must be exactly two differences
  // And these differences must be interchangeable
  return (
    difference.length === 2 && s[difference[0]] === goal[difference[1]] && s[difference[1]] === goal[difference[0]]
  );
};
```

**Python**

```py
def buddyStrings(s: str, goal: str) -> bool:
    if len(s) != len(goal):
        return False

    if s == goal and len(set(s)) < len(goal):
        return True

    diff = []
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] != goal[i]:
            diff.append(i)

    return len(diff) == 2 and s[diff[0]] == goal[diff[1]] and s[diff[1]] == goal[diff[0]]
```

```py
def buddyStrings(s: str, goal: str) -> bool:
    if len(s) != len(goal): return False
    diff1, diff2 = -1, -1
    letters = set()

    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] != goal[i]:
            if diff1 == -1:
                diff1 = i
            elif diff2 == -1:
                diff2 = i
            else:
                return False    # More than 2 difference places between the strings
        letters.add(s[i])

    if diff1 != -1 and diff2 != -1: # There are two differences
        return s[diff1] == goal[diff2] and s[diff2] == goal[diff1]

    if diff1 != -1: # Only have 1 difference
        return False

    return len(letters) < len(s)    # No difference - does s contain at least one duplicate?
```
