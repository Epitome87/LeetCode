# [3304. Find the K-th Character in String Game I](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-k-th-character-in-string-game-i)

## Description

Alice and Bob are playing a game. Initially, Alice has a string `word = "a"`.

You are given a **positive** integer `k`.

Now Bob will ask Alice to perform the following operation **forever**:

- Generate a new string by **changing** each character in `word` to its **next** character in the English alphabet, and **append** it to the _original_ `word`.

For example, performing the operation on `"c"` generates `"cd"` and performing the operation on `"zb"` generates `"zbac"`.

Return the value of the `kth` character in `word`, after enough operations have been done for `word` to have **at least** `k` characters.

**Note** that the character `'z'` can be changed to `'a'` in the operation.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** k = 5  
**Output:** "b"  
**Explanation:**

Initially, `word = "a"`. We need to do the operation three times:

- Generated string is `"b"`, `word` becomes `"ab"`.
- Generated string is `"bc"`, `word` becomes `"abbc"`.
- Generated string is `"bccd"`, `word` becomes `"abbcbccd"`.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** k = 10  
**Output:** "c"

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= k <= 500`

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
const countSetBits = (num) => {
  let setBits = 0;

  while (num > 0) {
    setBits += num & 1;
    num >>= 1;
  }

  return setBits;
};

// Approach: Increment 'a' by the number of set bits in k - 1
const kthCharacter = (k) => String.fromCharCode('a'.charCodeAt() + (countSetBits(k - 1) % 26));
```

| Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
| --------------- | ---------------- |
| O(1)            | O(1)             |

```js
// Approach: Brute-Force by simulating the process
const kthCharacter = (k) => {
  const result = [0];

  while (result.length < k) {
    const n = result.length;
    for (let i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
      result[n + i] = (result[i] + 1) % 26;
    }
  }

  return String.fromCharCode(result[k - 1] + 97);
};
```

| Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
| --------------- | ---------------- |
| O(k)            | O(k)             |
