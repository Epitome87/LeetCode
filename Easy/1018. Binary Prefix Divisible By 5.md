# [1018. Binary Prefix Divisible By 5](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-prefix-divisible-by-5)

## Description

You are given a binary array `nums` (**0-indexed**).

We define `xi` as the number whose binary representation is the subarray `nums[0..i]` (from most-significant-bit to least-significant-bit).

- For example, if `nums = [1,0,1]`, then `x0 = 1`, `x1 = 2`, and `x2 = 5`.

Return _an array of booleans_ `answer` _where_ `answer[i]` _is_ `true` _if_ `xi` _is divisible by_ `5`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[0,1,1\]  
**Output:** \[true,false,false\]  
**Explanation:** The input numbers in binary are 0, 01, 011; which are 0, 1, and 3 in base-10.  
Only the first number is divisible by 5, so answer\[0\] is true.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,1,1\]  
**Output:** \[false,false,false\]

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
- `nums[i]` is either `0` or `1`.

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
// Approach: Every new bit added to a number effectively doubles that number
// and adds that new bit value to it. So if we have binary 101 and append another 1 to it,
// we have (101 << 1) + 1, which is 1011, or 11 in decimal
const prefixesDivBy5 = (nums) => {
  const result = [];
  let remainder = 0;

  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; ++i) {
    // Double number, add the new bit value, and mod it by 5 to keep it within [0, 4]
    remainder = ((remainder << 1) + nums[i]) % 5;

    // If the remainder was 0 the binary prefix is divisible by 5
    result.push(remainder === 0);
  }

  return result;
};
```
