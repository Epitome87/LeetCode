# [1491. Average Salary Excluding the Minimum and Maximum Salary](https://leetcode.com/problems/average-salary-excluding-the-minimum-and-maximum-salary)

## Description

You are given an array of **unique** integers `salary` where `salary[i]` is the salary of the `ith` employee.

Return _the average salary of employees excluding the minimum and maximum salary_. Answers within `10-5` of the actual answer will be accepted.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** salary = [4000,3000,1000,2000]  
**Output:** 2500.00000  
**Explanation:** Minimum salary and maximum salary are 1000 and 4000 respectively.  
Average salary excluding minimum and maximum salary is (2000+3000) / 2 = 2500

**Example 2:**

**Input:** salary = [1000,2000,3000]  
**Output:** 2000.00000  
**Explanation:** Minimum salary and maximum salary are 1000 and 3000 respectively.  
Average salary excluding minimum and maximum salary is (2000) / 1 = 2000

**Constraints:**

- `3 <= salary.length <= 100`
- `1000 <= salary[i] <= 10^6`
- All the integers of `salary` are **unique**.

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
// Approach: One Pass
const average = (salary) => {
  let sum = 0;
  let max = -Infinity;
  let min = Infinity;

  for (let s of salary) {
    sum += s;
    min = Math.min(min, s);
    max = Math.max(max, s);
  }

  return (sum - min - max) / (salary.length - 2);
};
```

```js
const average = (salary) => {
  const totalSum = salary.reduce((acc, cur) => acc + cur, 0);
  const minSalary = Math.min(...salary);
  const maxSalary = Math.max(...salary);
  const averageMinusExtremes = (totalSum - minSalary - maxSalary) / (salary.length - 2);
  return averageMinusExtremes;
};
```
