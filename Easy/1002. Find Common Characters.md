# [1002. Find Common Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/)

## Description

Given a string array `words`, return _an array of all characters that show up in all strings within the_ `words` _(including duplicates)_. You may return the answer in **any order**.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** words = \["bella","label","roller"\]  
**Output:** \["e","l","l"\]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** words = \["cool","lock","cook"\]  
**Output:** \["c","o"\]

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= words.length <= 100`
- `1 <= words[i].length <= 100`
- `words[i]` consists of lowercase English letters.

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
const commonChars = (words) => {
  const result = [];
  const minFreq = Array(26).fill(Infinity);

  for (let word of words) {
    // Frequency count for each letter (a-z) in the current word
    const curFreq = Array(26).fill(0);

    for (let char of word) {
      curFreq[char.charCodeAt() - 97]++;
    }

    // Update minFreq, which will be the minimum between the count of
    // current char in this current word and the amount stored
    // in minFreq already. This ensures that a char that does not appear
    // in all words will be properly weeded out from our result, and that a char
    // that appears in all will have its frequency set to its lowest occurrence
    for (let j = 0; j < 26; j++) {
      minFreq[j] = Math.min(minFreq[j], curFreq[j]);
    }
  }

  for (let i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
    // How many common occurrences of this letter are there?
    // We have to push EACH one to the results array
    for (let count = 0; count < minFreq[i]; count++) {
      result.push(String.fromCharCode(i + 97));
    }
  }

  return result;
};
```

| Time Complexity                           | Space Complexity |
| ----------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| O(Number of words \* average word length) | O(1)             |
