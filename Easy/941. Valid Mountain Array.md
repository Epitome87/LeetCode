# [941. Valid Mountain Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-mountain-array)

## Description

Given an array of integers `arr`, return _`true` if and only if it is a valid mountain array_.

Recall that arr is a mountain array if and only if:

- `arr.length >= 3`
- There exists some `i` with `0 < i < arr.length - 1` such that:
  - `arr[0] < arr[1] < ... < arr[i - 1] < arr[i]`
  - `arr[i] > arr[i + 1] > ... > arr[arr.length - 1]`

**Example 1:**

**Input:** arr = \[2,1\]  
**Output:** false

**Example 2:**

**Input:** arr = \[3,5,5\]  
**Output:** false

**Example 3:**

**Input:** arr = \[0,3,2,1\]  
**Output:** true

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= arr.length <= 10^4`
- `0 <= arr[i] <= 10^4`

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
/*
Approach: Assume we have a climber at the left side of the mountain, and another at the right.
We have the left climber ascend until he reaches a plateau or a peak.
We have the right climber ascend in a similar manner. Each climber ascends towards one another.
A valid mountain will be such that the climbers end up meeting at the same spot (the peak).
*/
const validMountainArray = (arr) => {
  const n = arr.length;
  let i = 0; // Have one pointer begin at the start of mountain
  let j = n - 1; // And the other pointer begin at the end

  // Increment left pointer until we aren't strictly increasing (or we reach the end)
  while (i + 1 < n && arr[i] < arr[i + 1]) i++;

  // Decrement right pointer until we aren't strictly decreasing (or we reach the start)
  while (j > 0 && arr[j - 1] > arr[j]) j--;

  // We're a valid mountain if the pointers reached the same spot
  // and moved at least one step each
  return i === j && i > 0 && j < n - 1;
};
```

```js
// Approach: Count the number of peaks and valleys.
// Note that for a valid mountain, we can only have one peak and no valleys
const validMountainArray = (arr) => {
  let peak = 0;
  let valley = 0;

  for (let i = 1; i < arr.length - 1; i++) {
    // For i - 1, i, and i of [1, 2, 1], we have a peak. /\ in shape
    if (arr[i - 1] < arr[i] && arr[i] > arr[i + 1]) {
      peak++;
    }

    // For i - 1, i, and i of [3, 2, 3], we have a valley. \/ in shape
    if (arr[i - 1] >= arr[i] && arr[i] <= arr[i + 1]) {
      valley++;
    }
  }

  // We can only have 1 peak, and no valley
  return peak === 1 && valley === 0;
};
```
