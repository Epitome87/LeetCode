# [3330. Find the Original Typed String I](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-original-typed-string-i)

## Description

Alice is attempting to type a specific string on her computer. However, she tends to be clumsy and **may** press a key for too long, resulting in a character being typed **multiple** times.

Although Alice tried to focus on her typing, she is aware that she may still have done this **at most** _once_.

You are given a string `word`, which represents the **final** output displayed on Alice's screen.

Return the total number of _possible_ original strings that Alice _might_ have intended to type.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** word = "abbcccc"  
**Output:** 5  
**Explanation:**  
The possible strings are: `"abbcccc"`, `"abbccc"`, `"abbcc"`, `"abbc"`, and `"abcccc"`.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** word = "abcd"  
**Output:** 1  
**Explanation:**  
The only possible string is `"abcd"`.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** word = "aaaa"  
**Output:** 4

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= word.length <= 100`
- `word` consists only of lowercase English letters.

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
const possibleStringCount = (word) => {
  result = 1; // The word, as is, may be the one intended to be typed

  // Every time there is a consecutive character...
  // We may have meant to type anywhere from 1 to the length of that consecutive char
  for (let i = 1; i < word.length; i++) {
    if (word[i] === word[i - 1]) result++;
  }

  return result;
};
```

| Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
| --------------- | ---------------- |
| O(N)            | O(1)             |

```js
// Approach: Use regex to match all groups of consecutive characters.
// Then, for each match, sum together the match length minus 1.
// Finally, add 1 to this sum, as the original word also represents a possible result.
const possibleStringCount = (word) =>
  1 + (word.match(/(.)\1+/gi) || []).reduce((acc, cur) => acc + (cur.length - 1), 0);
```

| Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
| --------------- | ---------------- |
| O(N)            | O(N)             |

**Java**

```java
class Solution {
    public int possibleStringCount(String word) {
        int result = 1;

        for (int i = 1; i < word.length(); ++i) {
            if (word.charAt(i) == word.charAt(i - 1)) ++result;
        }

        return result;
    }
}
```

| Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
| --------------- | ---------------- |
| O(N)            | O(1)             |

**Python**

```python
def possibleStringCount(word: str) -> int:
    result = 1

    for i in range(1, len(word)):
        if word[i] == word[i - 1]:
            result += 1
    
    return result
```
