# [696. Count Binary Substrings](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-binary-substrings)

## Description

Given a binary string `s`, return the number of non-empty substrings that have the same number of `0`'s and `1`'s, and all the `0`'s and all the `1`'s in these substrings are grouped consecutively.

Substrings that occur multiple times are counted the number of times they occur.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "00110011"  
**Output:** 6  
**Explanation:** There are 6 substrings that have equal number of consecutive 1's and 0's: "0011", "01", "1100", "10", "0011", and "01".  
Notice that some of these substrings repeat and are counted the number of times they occur.  
Also, "00110011" is not a valid substring because all the 0's (and 1's) are not grouped together.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "10101"  
**Output:** 4  
**Explanation:** There are 4 substrings: "10", "01", "10", "01" that have equal number of consecutive 1's and 0's.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`
- `s[i]` is either `'0'` or `'1'`.

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
const countBinarySubstrings = function (s) {
  let result = 0;
  let prevLength = 0;
  let curLength = 1;

  for (let i = 1; i < s.length; ++i) {
    if (s[i] === s[i - 1]) ++curLength;
    else {
      prevLength = curLength;
      curLength = 1;
    }
    if (prevLength >= curLength) ++result;
  }

  return result;
};
```

**Python**

```python
def countBinarySubstrings(self, s: str) -> int:
    result = 0
    prev_length = 0
    cur_length = 1

    for i in range(1, len(s)):
        if s[i] == s[i - 1]:
            cur_length += 1
        else:
            prev_length = cur_length
            cur_length = 1
        if prev_length >= cur_length:
            result += 1

    return result
```

**Java**

```java
public int countBinarySubstrings(String s) {
    int result = 0;
    int prevLength = 0;
    int curLength = 1;

    for (int i = 1; i < s.length(); ++i) {
        if (s.charAt(i) == s.charAt(i - 1)) {
            ++curLength;
        } else {
            prevLength = curLength;
            curLength = 1;
        }
        if (prevLength >= curLength) {
            ++result;
        }
    }

    return result;
}
