# [1496. Path Crossing](https://leetcode.com/problems/path-crossing)

## Description

Given a string `path`, where `path[i] = 'N'`, `'S'`, `'E'` or `'W'`, each representing moving one unit north, south, east, or west, respectively. You start at the origin `(0, 0)` on a 2D plane and walk on the path specified by `path`.

Return `true` _if the path crosses itself at any point, that is, if at any time you are on a location you have previously visited_. Return `false` otherwise.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/06/10/screen-shot-2020-06-10-at-123929-pm.png)

**Input:** path = "NES"  
**Output:** false  
**Explanation:** Notice that the path doesn't cross any point more than once.

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/06/10/screen-shot-2020-06-10-at-123843-pm.png)

**Input:** path = "NESWW"  
**Output:** true  
**Explanation:** Notice that the path visits the origin twice.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= path.length <= 104`
- `path[i]` is either `'N'`, `'S'`, `'E'`, or `'W'`.

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
const isPathCrossing = (path) => {
  let x = 0; // Current x position
  let y = 0; // Current y position
  const visited = new Set(); // Keep track of visited positions in 'x,y' format
  visited.add(`${x},${y}`); // Mark our starting position as visited

  for (let char of path) {
    // Alter our current x or y coordinate appropriately
    if (char === 'N') ++y;
    if (char === 'S') --y;
    if (char === 'E') --x;
    if (char === 'W') ++x;

    // Form our position string, check if we've been here, and mark as visited
    const curPos = `${x},${y}`;
    if (visited.has(curPos)) return true;
    visited.add(curPos);
  }

  // We made it through all paths without crossing over
  return false;
};
```
