# [2078. Two Furthest Houses With Different Colors](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-furthest-houses-with-different-colors)

## Description

There are `n` houses evenly lined up on the street, and each house is beautifully painted. You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `colors` of length `n`, where `colors[i]` represents the color of the `ith` house.

Return _the **maximum** distance between **two** houses with **different** colors_.

The distance between the `ith` and `jth` houses is `abs(i - j)`, where `abs(x)` is the **absolute value** of `x`.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/10/31/eg1.png)

**Input:** colors = [**1**,1,1,**6**,1,1,1]  
**Output:** 3  
**Explanation:** In the above image, color 1 is blue, and color 6 is red.  
The furthest two houses with different colors are house 0 and house 3.  
House 0 has color 1, and house 3 has color 6. The distance between them is abs(0 - 3) = 3.  
Note that houses 3 and 6 can also produce the optimal answer.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** colors = [**1**,8,3,8,**3**]  
**Output:** 4  
**Explanation:** In the above image, color 1 is blue, color 8 is yellow, and color 3 is green.  
The furthest two houses with different colors are house 0 and house 4.  
House 0 has color 1, and house 4 has color 3. The distance between them is abs(0 - 4) = 4.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** colors = [**0**,**1**]  
**Output:** 1  
**Explanation:** The furthest two houses with different colors are house 0 and house 1.  
House 0 has color 0, and house 1 has color 1. The distance between them is abs(0 - 1) = 1.

**Constraints:**

- `n ==Â colors.length`
- `2 <= n <= 100`
- `0 <= colors[i] <= 100`
- Test data are generated such that **at least** two houses have different colors.

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
/*
Approach: We note that for the furthest two houses, one of them must either be the left-most house or the right-most house.
*/
const maxDistance = (colors) => {
  let i = 0;
  let j = colors.length - 1;

  // Find the last house with a color different than the first house.
  while (colors[0] === colors[j]) --j;
  // Find the first house with different color than the last house.
  while (colors[colors.length - 1] === colors[i]) ++i;

  return Math.max(j, colors.length - 1 - i);
};
```

| O(N)            | O(1)             |

```js
// Approach: Brute-Force by checking all two-house combinations
const maxDistance = (colors) => {
  let result = 0;

  for (let i = 0; i < colors.length; ++i) {
    for (let j = i + 1; j < colors.length; ++j) {
      if (colors[i] !== colors[j]) result = Math.max(result, j - i);
    }
  }

  return result;
};
```
