# [392. Is Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/is-subsequence)

## Description

Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` _if_ `s` _is a **subsequence** of_ `t`_, or_ `false` _otherwise_.

A **subsequence** of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., `"ace"` is a subsequence of `"abcde"` while `"aec"` is not).

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"  
**Output:** true

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"  
**Output:** false

**Constraints:**

- `0 <= s.length <= 100`
- `0 <= t.length <= 104`
- `s` and `t` consist only of lowercase English letters.

**Follow up:** Suppose there are lots of incoming `s`, say `s1, s2, ..., sk` where `k >= 109`, and you want to check one by one to see if `t` has its subsequence. In this scenario, how would you change your code?

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
const isSubsequence = (s, t) => {
  // Keep track of current index of S and T, respectively
  let indexS = 0;
  let indexT = 0;

  // While both indices are within their respective bounds...
  while (indexS < s.length && indexT < t.length) {
    // Found current char in S? Move onto the next one
    if (s[indexS] === t[indexT]) indexS++;

    // Whether we found the current S char or not, we move onto the next T char
    indexT++;
  }

  // Did the S index reach the length of the S string?
  // That means we found all of its characters in T
  return indexS === s.length;
};
```

```js
const isSubsequence = (s, t) => {
  let indexS = 0;

  for (let indexT = 0; indexS < s.length && indexT < t.length; indexT++) {
    if (s[indexS] === t[indexT]) indexS++;
  }

  return indexS === s.length;
};
```
