# [482. License Key Formatting](https://leetcode.com/problems/license-key-formatting)

## Description

You are given a license key represented as a string `s` that consists of only alphanumeric characters and dashes. The string is separated into `n + 1` groups by `n` dashes. You are also given an integer `k`.

We want to reformat the string `s` such that each group contains exactly `k` characters, except for the first group, which could be shorter than `k` but still must contain at least one character. Furthermore, there must be a dash inserted between two groups, and you should convert all lowercase letters to uppercase.

Return _the reformatted license key_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "5F3Z-2e-9-w", k = 4  
**Output:** "5F3Z-2E9W"  
**Explanation:** The string s has been split into two parts, each part has 4 characters.  
Note that the two extra dashes are not needed and can be removed.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "2-5g-3-J", k = 2  
**Output:** "2-5G-3J"  
**Explanation:** The string s has been split into three parts, each part has 2 characters except the first part as it could be shorter as mentioned above.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`
- `s` consists of English letters, digits, and dashes `'-'`.
- `1 <= k <= 10^4`

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
const licenseKeyFormatting = (s, k) => {
  const groups = [];

  // Immediately rid of the dashes, as we need to ignore them
  s = s.replaceAll('-', '');

  // If we can't evenly group all characters, the head will be the uneven grouping
  const head = s.length % k;

  if (head) {
    groups.push(s.substring(0, head));
  }

  // Put characters into groups of length k
  for (let i = head; i < s.length; i += k) {
    groups.push(s.substring(i, i + k));
  }

  // We have our groupings -- put a dash between them and ensure they are capitalized
  return groups.join('-').toUpperCase();
};
```
