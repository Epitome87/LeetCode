# [2960. Count Tested Devices After Test Operations](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-tested-devices-after-test-operations)

## Description

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `batteryPercentages` having length `n`, denoting the battery percentages of `n` **0-indexed** devices.

Your task is to test each device `i` **in order** from `0` to `n - 1`, by performing the following test operations:

- If `batteryPercentages[i]` is **greater** than `0`:
  - **Increment** the count of tested devices.
  - **Decrease** the battery percentage of all devices with indices `j` in the range `[i + 1, n - 1]` by `1`, ensuring their battery percentage **never goes below** `0`, i.e, `batteryPercentages[j] = max(0, batteryPercentages[j] - 1)`.
  - Move to the next device.
- Otherwise, move to the next device without performing any test.

Return _an integer denoting the number of devices that will be tested after performing the test operations in order._

**Example 1:**

**Input:** batteryPercentages = [1,1,2,1,3]  
**Output:** 3  
**Explanation:** Performing the test operations in order starting from device 0:  
At device 0, batteryPercentages[0] > 0, so there is now 1 tested device, and batteryPercentages becomes [1,0,1,0,2].  
At device 1, batteryPercentages[1] == 0, so we move to the next device without testing.  
At device 2, batteryPercentages[2] > 0, so there are now 2 tested devices, and batteryPercentages becomes [1,0,1,0,1].  
At device 3, batteryPercentages[3] == 0, so we move to the next device without testing.  
At device 4, batteryPercentages[4] > 0, so there are now 3 tested devices, and batteryPercentages stays the same.  
So, the answer is 3.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** batteryPercentages = [0,1,2]  
**Output:** 2  
**Explanation:** Performing the test operations in order starting from device 0:  
At device 0, batteryPercentages[0] == 0, so we move to the next device without testing.  
At device 1, batteryPercentages[1] > 0, so there is now 1 tested device, and batteryPercentages becomes [0,1,1].  
At device 2, batteryPercentages[2] > 0, so there are now 2 tested devices, and batteryPercentages stays the same.  
So, the answer is 2.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n == batteryPercentages.length <= 100`
- `0 <= batteryPercentages[i] <= 100`

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
// Approach: Instead of using a nested loop to decrement each battery
// after the current one (assuming the current one can be tested), we can
// use simple math. For any battery (battery[i]), we can only test it if it has
// battery remaining. The amount of battery it has left is the amount it started with
// minus how many devices we've successfully tested so far (as each one drops the battery
// by 1).
const countTestedDevices = (batteryPercentages) => {
  let numTested = 0;

  for (let b of batteryPercentages) {
    // If the current battery percentage minus 1% for
    // each device successfully tested before this one is > 0,
    // we can test this device.
    if (b - numTested > 0) ++numTested;
    // Can also write if (b > numTested > 0) ++numTested;
  }

  return numTested;
};
```

```js
// Approach: Brute-Force by simulating the process
const countTestedDevices = (batteryPercentages) => {
  let result = 0;

  for (let i = 0; i < batteryPercentages.length; ++i) {
    if (batteryPercentages[i] > 0) {
      // This device can be tested
      ++result;

      // And we drain every device after this by 1% battery,
      // ensuring its charge does not drop below 0.
      for (let j = i + 1; j < batteryPercentages.length; ++j) {
        batteryPercentages[j] = Math.max(0, --batteryPercentages[j]);
      }
    }
  }

  return result;
};
