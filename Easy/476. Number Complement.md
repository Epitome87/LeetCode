# [476. Number Complement](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-complement)

## Description

The **complement** of an integer is the integer you get when you flip all the `0`'s to `1`'s and all the `1`'s to `0`'s in its binary representation.

- For example, The integer `5` is `"101"` in binary and its **complement** is `"010"` which is the integer `2`.

Given an integer `num`, return _its complement_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** num = 5  
**Output:** 2  
**Explanation:** The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** num = 1  
**Output:** 0  
**Explanation:** The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 0. So you need to output 0.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= num < 2^31`

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
const findComplement = (num) => {
  let mask = 1;

  while (mask < num) {
    mask = (mask << 1) + 1;
  }

  return mask ^ num;
};
```

| Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
| --------------- | ---------------- |
| O(Log(N))       | O(1)             |

```js
// Find the first number x such that x = 1111...1 > n
// We do this because n + complement = 1111...1
// So complement = 1111...1 - n
const findComplement = (num) => {
  let x = 1;

  while (num > x) {
    x = x * 2 + 1;
  }

  return x - num;
};
```

| Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
| --------------- | ---------------- |
| O(Log(N))       | O(1)             |
