# [868. Binary Gap](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-gap)

## Description

Given a positive integer `n`, find and return _the **longest distance** between any two **adjacent**_ `1`_'s in the binary representation of_ `n`_. If there are no two adjacent_ `1`_'s, return_ `0`_._

Two `1`'s are **adjacent** if there are only `0`'s separating them (possibly no `0`'s). The **distance** between two `1`'s is the absolute difference between their bit positions. For example, the two `1`'s in `"1001"` have a distance of 3.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 22  
**Output:** 2  
**Explanation:** 22 in binary is "10110".  
The first adjacent pair of 1's is "10110" with a distance of 2.  
The second adjacent pair of 1's is "10110" with a distance of 1.  
The answer is the largest of these two distances, which is 2.  
Note that "10110" is not a valid pair since there is a 1 separating the two 1's underlined.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 8  
**Output:** 0  
**Explanation:** 8 in binary is "1000".  
There are not any adjacent pairs of 1's in the binary representation of 8, so we return 0.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** n = 5  
**Output:** 2  
**Explanation:** 5 in binary is "101".

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 10^9`

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
const binaryGap = (n) => {
  let result = 0;

  for (let distance = -32; n > 0; n >>= 1, ++distance) {
    if (n & 1) {
      result = Math.max(result, distance);
      distance = 0;
    }
  }

  return result;
};
```

| Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
| --------------- | ---------------- |
| O(Log(N))       | O(1)             |

```js
const binaryGap = (n) => {
  let result = 0;

  // Ensures that for cases where there is only a single 1 we return a 0 rather than how many 0's are after the 1
  let distance = -32;

  while (n) {
    // Is last digit a 1?
    if (n & 1) {
      // If so, we have a possible new longest distance
      result = Math.max(result, distance);

      // We reset the distance to 0 so the next time we find a 1 the distance is
      // compared to this current 1 rather than the previous
      distance = 0;
    }

    // Move onto the next digit and increment distance
    n = n >> 1;
    ++distance;
  }

  return result;
};
```

| Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
| --------------- | ---------------- |
| O(Log(N))       | O(1)             |

```js
// Approach: Brute-Force with string conversion
const binaryGap = (n) => {
  let result = 0;
  const binaryStr = n.toString(2);

  for (let i = 0; i < binaryStr.length; ++i) {
    if (binaryStr[i] !== '1') continue;

    for (let j = i + 1; j < binaryStr.length; ++j) {
      if (binaryStr[j] === '1') {
        result = Math.max(result, j - i);
        break;
      }
    }
  }

  return result;
};
```
