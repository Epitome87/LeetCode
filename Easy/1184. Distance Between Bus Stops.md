# [1184. Distance Between Bus Stops](https://leetcode.com/problems/distance-between-bus-stops)

## Description

A bus has `n` stops numbered from `0` to `n - 1` that form a circle. We know the distance between all pairs of neighboring stops where `distance[i]` is the distance between the stops number `i` and `(i + 1) % n`.

The bus goes along both directions i.e. clockwise and counterclockwise.

Return the shortest distance between the given `start` and `destination` stops.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** distance = \[1,2,3,4\], start = 0, destination = 1  
**Output:** 1  
**Explanation:** Distance between 0 and 1 is 1 or 9, minimum is 1.

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/09/03/untitled-diagram-1-1.jpg)

**Input:** distance = \[1,2,3,4\], start = 0, destination = 2  
**Output:** 3  
**Explanation:** Distance between 0 and 2 is 3 or 7, minimum is 3.

**Example 3:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/09/03/untitled-diagram-1-2.jpg)

**Input:** distance = \[1,2,3,4\], start = 0, destination = 3  
**Output:** 4  
**Explanation:** Distance between 0 and 3 is 6 or 4, minimum is 4.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 10^4`
- `distance.length == n`
- `0 <= start, destination < n`
- `0 <= distance[i] <= 10^4`

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
// Approach: Single pass
const distanceBetweenBusStops = (distance, start, destination) => {
  let path1Distance = 0;
  let path2Distance = 0;

  // Ensure start is less than destination
  if (start > destination) [start, destination] = [destination, start];

  for (let i = 0; i < distance.length; ++i) {
    // Path 1 is all distances from start to destination
    if (i >= start && i < destination) path1Distance += distance[i];
    // Path 2 is all other distances (opposite direction)
    else path2Distance += distance[i];
  }

  return Math.min(path1Distance, path2Distance);
};
```

```js
const distanceBetweenBusStops = (distance, start, destination) => {
  let path1Distance = 0;
  let path2Distance = 0;

  // Check the route from start to destination
  for (let i = start; i !== destination; i = (i + 1) % distance.length) {
    path1Distance += distance[i];
  }

  // Check the route from destination to start
  for (let i = destination; i !== start; i = (i + 1) % distance.length) {
    path2Distance += distance[i];
  }

  return Math.min(path1Distance, path2Distance);
};
```

```js
const distanceBetweenBusStops = (distance, start, destination) => {
  // Swap start and destination to retain ascending order
  if (start > destination) [start, destination] = [destination, start];

  const distanceTotal = distance.reduce((acc, cur) => acc + cur, 0);
  let distanceClockwise = distance.slice(start, destination).reduce((acc, cur) => acc + cur, 0);
  let distanceCounter = distanceTotal - distanceClockwise;

  return Math.min(distanceClockwise, distanceCounter);
};
```
