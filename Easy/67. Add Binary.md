# [67. Add Binary](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-binary)

## Description

Given two binary strings `a` and `b`, return _their sum as a binary string_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** a = "11", b = "1"  
**Output:** "100"

**Example 2:**

**Input:** a = "1010", b = "1011"  
**Output:** "10101"

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= a.length, b.length <= 10^4`
- `a` and `b` consistÂ only of `'0'` or `'1'` characters.
- Each string does not contain leading zeros except for the zero itself.

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
const addBinary = (a, b) => {
  let result = '';

  // Pointer for strings A and B. Traversing in reverse
  let i = a.length - 1;
  let j = b.length - 1;
  let carry = 0;

  while (i >= 0 || j >= 0) {
    // Our current sum starts as whatever the carry last was
    let sum = carry;

    // Now add the binary digit in strings A and B, if they exist
    // (Remember, they can be of different lengths)
    // Also decrement the pointer after we process it
    if (i >= 0) sum += +a[i--];
    if (j >= 0) sum += +b[j--];

    // We have a carry if the sum is greater than 1
    carry = sum > 1 ? 1 : 0;

    /*
    Possible outcomes:
    Sum is 0: Result is 0 and Carry is 0
    Sum is 1: Result is 1 and Carry is 0
    Sum is 2: Result is 0 and Carry is 1
    Sum is 3: Result is 1 and Carry is 1
        This scenario happens if the previous carry is 1, and both A and B are 1
    */

    // We use modulo on the sum, so we can get the remainder
    // of it and add it to the result
    result += sum % 2;
  }

  // Did we finish our iteration with a leftover carry?
  // If so, add it to the result.
  if (carry) result += carry;

  // And remember, we built up our array by adding backwards
  // So we must reverse the result
  return [...result].reverse().join('');
};
```

```js
const addBinary = (a, b) => (BigInt('0b' + a) + BigInt('0b' + b)).toString(2);
```
