# [3289. The Two Sneaky Numbers of Digitville](https://leetcode.com/problems/the-two-sneaky-numbers-of-digitville)

## Description

In the town of Digitville, there was a list of numbers called `nums` containing integers from `0` to `n - 1`. Each number was supposed to appear **exactly once** in the list, however, **two** mischievous numbers sneaked in an _additional time_, making the list longer than usual.

As the town detective, your task is to find these two sneaky numbers. Return an array of size **two** containing the two numbers (in _any order_), so peace can return to Digitville.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[0,1,1,0\]  
**Output:** \[0,1\]  
**Explanation:**  
The numbers 0 and 1 each appear twice in the array.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[0,3,2,1,3,2\]  
**Output:** \[2,3\]  
**Explanation:**  
The numbers 2 and 3 each appear twice in the array.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = \[7,1,5,4,3,4,6,0,9,5,8,2\]  
**Output:** \[4,5\]  
**Explanation:**  
The numbers 4 and 5 each appear twice in the array.

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= n <= 100`
- `nums.length == n + 2`
- `0 <= nums[i] < n`
- The input is generated such that `nums` contains **exactly** two repeated elements.

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
// Approach: Mark a number as visited by flipping its sign when we encounter it.
// Running into a negative number means we have visited it before.
// Note we can do this because our constraints say all nums are >= 0.
// Since 0 cannot be made negative, we add the length of the input array to each
// number we keep track of.
const getSneakyNumbers = (nums) => {
  const n = nums.length;
  const result = [];

  for (let num of nums) {
    let index = num < 0 ? num + n : num;

    // Negative means this num is a duplicate; push it to our results.
    if (nums[index] < 0) result.push(index);
    // Mark this now-visited num as visited by negating it.
    else nums[index] -= n;
  }

  return result;
};
```

```js
// Approach: Same as above, but perhaps a little easier to understand
const getSneakyNumbers = (nums) => {
  const n = nums.length;
  const result = [];

  // Increment each num by 1 so we can check if 0 becomes negative
  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) nums[i]++;

  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const index = Math.abs(nums[i]);

    // If num is negative, we've seen it before.
    // Remember, each num has been incremented by 1. The actual result needs to be decremented by 1.
    if (nums[index] < 0) result.push(index - 1);
    // Otherwise, we haven't seen this num before; mark it as seen by negating it.
    else nums[index] *= -1;
  }

  return result;
};
```

| Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
| --------------- | ---------------- |
| O(N)            | O(1)             |

```js
// Approach: Use a bucket where the index represents the value in nums.
const getSneakyNumbers = (nums) => {
  const result = [];
  const bucket = Array(102).fill(0);

  // When we encounter a number, use its value as its insertion
  // index into bucket. I.e num = 3 means bucket[3]++;
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    bucket[nums[i]]++;
  }

  for (let i = 0; i < bucket.length; i++) {
    if (bucket[i] > 1) result.push(i);
  }

  return result;
};
```

| Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
| --------------- | ---------------- |
| O(N)            | O(1)             |

```js
// Approach: Use a set to detect duplicate numbers
const getSneakyNumbers = (nums) => {
  const seen = new Set();
  const result = [];

  for (let num of nums) {
    if (seen.has(num)) {
      result.push(num);
      if (result.length === 2) return result;
    }
    seen.add(num);
  }
};
```

| Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
| --------------- | ---------------- |
| O(N)            | O(N)             |

```js
// Approach: Sort so we can detect duplicates side-by-side, thus removing the need for a Set.
const getSneakyNumbers = (nums) => {
  const result = [];
  nums.sort((a, b) => a - b);

  for (let i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
    if (nums[i] === nums[i - 1]) {
      result.push(nums[i]);
      if (result.length === 2) return result;
    }
  }

  return result;
};
```

| --------------- | ---------------- |
| O(N \* Log(N))  | O(1)             |
