# [3178. Find the Child Who Has the Ball After K Seconds](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-child-who-has-the-ball-after-k-seconds)

## Description

You are given two **positive** integers `n` and `k`. There are `n` children numbered from `0` to `n - 1` standing in a queue _in order_ from left to right.

Initially, child 0 holds a ball and the direction of passing the ball is towards the right direction. After each second, the child holding the ball passes it to the child next to them. Once the ball reaches **either** end of the line, i.e. child 0 or child `n - 1`, the direction of passing is **reversed**.

Return the number of the child who receives the ball after `k` seconds.

**Example 1:**  
**Input:** n = 3, k = 5  
**Output:** 1

**Example 2:**  
**Input:** n = 5, k = 6  
**Output:** 2

**Example 3:**  
**Input:** n = 4, k = 2  
**Output:** 2

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= n <= 50`
- `1 <= k <= 50`

**Note:** This question is the same as [2582: Pass the Pillow.](https://leetcode.com/problems/pass-the-pillow/description/)

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
const numberOfChild = (n, k) => {
  --n; // This will help simplify calculation (so range is now 0 to n - 1);
  let rounds = Math.floor(k / n); // Calculate the number of complete back-and-forths
  let remainder = k % n; // Calculate the remaining steps after the last complete trip

  // If the number of full back-and-forths is odd...
  // The ball is passed backward from the end
  if (rounds % 2) return n - remainder;
  // If the number of full back-and-forths is even...
  // The ball is passed forward from the start
  else return remainder;
};
```

| Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
| --------------- | ---------------- |
| O(1)            | O(1)             |

```js
// Approach: Brute-Force by simulating the process
const numberOfChild = (n, k) => {
  let position = 0;
  let direction = 1;

  for (let steps = 0; steps < k; ++steps) {
    position += direction;

    if (position === 0 || position === n - 1) {
      direction *= -1;
    }
  }

  return position;
};
```

| Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
| --------------- | ---------------- |
| O(K)            | O(1)             |
