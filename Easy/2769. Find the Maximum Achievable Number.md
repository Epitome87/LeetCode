# [2769. Find the Maximum Achievable Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-maximum-achievable-number)

## Description

Given two integers, `num` and `t`. A **number** `x` is **achievable** if it can become equal to `num` after applying the following operation **at most** `t` times:

- Increase or decrease `x` by `1`, and _simultaneously_ increase or decrease `num` by `1`.

Return the **maximum** possible value of `x`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** num = 4, t = 1  
**Output:** 6  
**Explanation:**

Apply the following operation once to make the maximum achievable number equal to `num`:

- Decrease the maximum achievable number by 1, and increase `num` by 1.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** num = 3, t = 2  
**Output:** 7  
**Explanation:**

Apply the following operation twice to make the maximum achievable number equal to `num`:

- Decrease the maximum achievable number by 1, and increase `num` by 1.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= num, tÂ <= 50`

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
const theMaximumAchievableX = (num, t) => num + t * 2;
```
