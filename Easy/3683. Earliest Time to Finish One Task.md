# [3683. Earliest Time to Finish One Task](https://leetcode.com/problems/earliest-time-to-finish-one-task)

## Description

You are given a 2D integer array `tasks` where `tasks[i] = [si, ti]`.

Each `[si, ti]` in `tasks` represents a task with start time `si` that takes `ti` units of time to finish.

Return the earliest time at which at least one task is finished.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** tasks = \[\[1,6\],\[2,3\]\]  
**Output:** 5  
**Explanation:**  
The first task starts at time `t = 1` and finishes at time `1 + 6 = 7`. The second task finishes at time `2 + 3 = 5`. You can finish one task at time 5.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** tasks = \[\[100,100\],\[100,100\],\[100,100\]\]  
**Output:** 200  
**Explanation:**  
All three tasks finish at time `100 + 100 = 200`.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= tasks.length <= 100`
- `tasks[i] = [si, ti]`
- `1 <= si, ti <= 100`

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
// Approach: Single pass
const earliestTime = (tasks) => {
  let earliestTime = Infinity;

  for (const [start, time] of tasks) {
    earliestTime = Math.min(earliestTime, start + time);
  }

  return earliestTime;
};
```

| Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
| --------------- | ---------------- |
| O(N)            | O(1)             |

```js
const earliestTime = (tasks) => tasks.reduce((min, [start, time]) => Math.min(min, start + time), Infinity);
```

| Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
| --------------- | ---------------- |
| O(N)            | O(1)             |

```js
const earliestTime = (tasks) => Math.min(...tasks.map(([start, time]) => start + time));
```

| Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
| --------------- | ---------------- |
| O(N)            | O(N)             |

**Python**

```python
# Note that the generator expression is lazy adn does not store all the values, unlike the above JS solution
def earliestTime(self, tasks):
    return min(start + time for start, time in tasks)
```
