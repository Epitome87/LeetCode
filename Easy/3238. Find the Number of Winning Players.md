# [3238. Find the Number of Winning Players](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-number-of-winning-players)

## Description

You are given an integer `n` representing the number of players in a game and a 2D array `pick` where `pick[i] = [xi, yi]` represents that the player `xi` picked a ball of color `yi`.

Player `i` **wins** the game if they pick **strictly more** than `i` balls of the **same** color. In other words,

- Player 0 wins if they pick any ball.
- Player 1 wins if they pick at least two balls of the _same_ color.
- ...
- Player `i` wins if they pick at least`i + 1` balls of the _same_ color.

Return the number of players who **win** the game.

**Note** that _multiple_ players can win the game.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 4, pick = [[0,0],[1,0],[1,0],[2,1],[2,1],[2,0]]  
**Output:** 2  
**Explanation:**  
Player 0 and player 1 win the game, while players 2 and 3 do not win.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 5, pick = [[1,1],[1,2],[1,3],[1,4]]  
**Output:** 0  
**Explanation:**  
No player wins the game.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** n = 5, pick = [[1,1],[2,4],[2,4],[2,4]]  
**Output:** 1  
**Explanation:**  
Player 2 wins the game by picking 3 balls with color 4.

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= n <= 10`
- `1 <= pick.length <= 100`
- `pick[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= xi <= n - 1`
- `0 <= yi <= 10`

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
const winningPlayerCount = (n, pick) => {
  // Players and balls are 0-based integers, so use 2D array to map them.
  // colorCounts[0][2] represents how many color #2 balls player #0 has, etc.
  const colorCounts = Array.from({ length: n }, () => Array(11).fill(0));
  for (let [player, color] of pick) colorCounts[player][color]++;

  // Iterate over each player...
  let count = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    // And check each ball color to see if this player picked > i of any color.
    if (colorCounts[i].some((val) => val > i)) {
      ++count;
    }
  }

  return count;
};
```
