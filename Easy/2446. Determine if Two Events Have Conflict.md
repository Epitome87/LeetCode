# [2446. Determine if Two Events Have Conflict](https://leetcode.com/problems/determine-if-two-events-have-conflict)

## Description

You are given two arrays of strings that represent two inclusive events that happened **on the same day**, `event1` and `event2`, where:

- `event1 = [startTime1, endTime1]` and
- `event2 = [startTime2, endTime2]`.

Event times are valid 24 hours format in the form of `HH:MM`.

A **conflict** happens when two events have some non-empty intersection (i.e., some moment is common to both events).

Return `true` _if there is a conflict between two events. Otherwise, return_ `false`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** event1 = ["01:15","02:00"], event2 = ["02:00","03:00"]  
**Output:** true  
**Explanation:** The two events intersect at time 2:00.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** event1 = ["01:00","02:00"], event2 = ["01:20","03:00"]  
**Output:** true  
**Explanation:** The two events intersect starting from 01:20 to 02:00.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** event1 = ["10:00","11:00"], event2 = ["14:00","15:00"]  
**Output:** false  
**Explanation:** The two events do not intersect.

**Constraints:**

- `event1.length == event2.length == 2`
- `event1[i].length == event2[i].length == 5`
- `startTime1 <= endTime1`
- `startTime2 <= endTime2`
- All the event times follow the `HH:MM` format.

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
const haveConflict = (event1, event2) => {
  // When does a conflict occur?
  // The start of event 1 comes before the end of event 2 and
  // the start of event 2 comes before the end of event 1
  return event1[0] <= event2[1] && event2[0] <= event1[1];

  // Another way to say this is a conflict occurs if the later event's start time
  // is earlier than the earliest event's end time.
  // return Math.max(event1[0], event2[0]) <= Math.min(event1[1], event2[1]);
};
```
