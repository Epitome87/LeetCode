# [1725. Number of Rectangles That Can Form the Largest Square](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-rectangles-that-can-form-the-largest-square)

## Description

You are given an array `rectangles` where `rectangles[i] = [li, wi]` represents the `ith` rectangle of length `li` and width `wi`.

You can cut the `ith` rectangle to form a square with a side length of `k` if both `k <= li` and `k <= wi`. For example, if you have a rectangle `[4,6]`, you can cut it to get a square with a side length of at most `4`.

Let `maxLen` be the side length of the **largest** square you can obtain from any of the given rectangles.

Return _the **number** of rectangles that can make a square with a side length of_ `maxLen`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** rectangles = [[5,8],[3,9],[5,12],[16,5]]  
**Output:** 3  
**Explanation:** The largest squares you can get from each rectangle are of lengths [5,3,5,5].  
The largest possible square is of length 5, and you can get it out of 3 rectangles.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** rectangles = [[2,3],[3,7],[4,3],[3,7]]  
**Output:** 3

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= rectangles.length <= 1000`
- `rectangles[i].length == 2`
- `1 <= li, wi <= 109`
- `li != wi`

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
// Approach: Avoiding a hash map by simply incrementing how often
// the largest length occurs.
const countGoodRectangles = (rectangles) => {
  let largestLength = 0;
  let largestLengthCount = 0;

  for (let [l, w] of rectangles) {
    const smallerSide = Math.min(l, w);
    if (smallerSide > largestLength) {
      largestLength = smallerSide;
      largestLengthCount = 1;
    } else if (smallerSide === largestLength) {
      ++largestLengthCount;
    }
  }

  return largestLengthCount;
};
```

```js
// Approach: Single-Pass using hash map
const countGoodRectangles = (rectangles) => {
  const map = {};
  let largestLength = 0;

  for (let [l, w] of rectangles) {
    const smallestSide = Math.min(l, w);
    if (smallestSide >= largestLength) {
      largestLength = smallestSide;
      map[largestLength] = map[largestLength] + 1 || 1;
    }
  }

  return map[largestLength];
};
```

| Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
| --------------- | ---------------- |
| O(N)            | O(N)             |

```js
// Approach: Using multiple passes with a hash map
const countGoodRectangles = (rectangles) => {
  // Map smallest rectangle side to its frequency
  // We are concerned with the smallest side because we need to make a square,
  // thus we are limited by the dimension of the smaller of the length or width.
  const map = {};
  for (let [l, w] of rectangles) {
    const smallestSide = Math.min(l, w);
    map[smallestSide] = map[smallestSide] + 1 || 1;
  }

  // Determine what the largest square length found was
  const largestLength = Math.max(...Object.keys(map));

  // Determine the frequency of that largest length
  const freqOfLargest = map[largestLength];

  return freqOfLargest;
};
```
