# [599. Minimum Index Sum of Two Lists](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-index-sum-of-two-lists)

## Description

Given two arrays of strings `list1` and `list2`, find the **common strings with the least index sum**.

A **common string** is a string that appeared in both `list1` and `list2`.

A **common string with the least index sum** is a common string such that if it appeared at `list1[i]` and `list2[j]` then `i + j` should be the minimum value among all the other **common strings**.

Return _all the **common strings with the least index sum**_. Return the answer in **any order**.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** list1 = \["Shogun","Tapioca Express","Burger King","KFC"\], list2 = \["Piatti","The Grill at Torrey Pines","Hungry Hunter Steakhouse","Shogun"\]  
**Output:** \["Shogun"\]  
**Explanation:** The only common string is "Shogun".

**Example 2:**

**Input:** list1 = \["Shogun","Tapioca Express","Burger King","KFC"\], list2 = \["KFC","Shogun","Burger King"\]  
**Output:** \["Shogun"\]  
**Explanation:** The common string with the least index sum is "Shogun" with index sum = (0 + 1) = 1.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** list1 = \["happy","sad","good"\], list2 = \["sad","happy","good"\]  
**Output:** \["sad","happy"\]  
**Explanation:** There are three common strings:  
"happy" with index sum = (0 + 1) = 1.  
"sad" with index sum = (1 + 0) = 1.  
"good" with index sum = (2 + 2) = 4.  
The strings with the least index sum are "sad" and "happy".

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= list1.length, list2.length <= 1000`
- `1 <= list1[i].length, list2[i].length <= 30`
- `list1[i]` and `list2[i]` consist of spaces `' '` and English letters.
- All the strings of `list1` are **unique**.
- All the strings of `list2` are **unique**.
- There is at least a common string between `list1` and `list2`.

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
const findRestaurant = (list1, list2) => {
  let result = [];
  let leastIndexSum = Infinity;

  // Keep track of each str and its index for O(1) look-up as we iterate list2
  const indicesA = list1.reduce((acc, cur, idx) => ((acc[cur] = idx), acc), {});

  for (let i = 0; i < list2.length; i++) {
    const str = list2[i];

    // Is this string also in list1?
    if (str in indicesA) {
      // Determine if the sum of their indices makes it the new minimum
      const indexSum = indicesA[str] + i;

      // Tied with minimum means we add this to the current result
      if (indexSum === leastIndexSum) result.push(str);
      // But less than current minimum means we toss out the current result and start with this one
      else if (indexSum < leastIndexSum) {
        result = [str];
        leastIndexSum = indexSum;
      }
    }
  }

  return result;
};
```
