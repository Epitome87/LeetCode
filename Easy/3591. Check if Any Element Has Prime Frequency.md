# [3591. Check if Any Element Has Prime Frequency](https://leetcode.com/problems/check-if-any-element-has-prime-frequency)

## Description

You are given an integer array `nums`.

Return `true` if the frequency of any element of the array is **prime**, otherwise, return `false`.

The **frequency** of an element `x` is the number of times it occurs in the array.

A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 with only two factors, 1 and itself.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,2,3,4,5,4\]  
**Output:** true  
**Explanation:**  
4 has a frequency of two, which is a prime number.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,2,3,4,5\]  
**Output:** false  
**Explanation:**  
All elements have a frequency of one.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = \[2,2,2,4,4\]  
**Output:** true  
**Explanation:**  
Both 2 and 4 have a prime frequency.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 100`

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
/*
Approach: Use properties of primes and the <= 100 input values to our advantage.
If a number has a frequency of 2, 3, 5, or 7, we can return true. If the frequency is divisible by those
numbers (or is 1), we know it's not a prime frequency. All other frequencies are prime.
The key insight here is that a prime of 11 would give 11x11 = 121, which is larger than the 100
guaranteed to be an input constraint. So the largest prime we must check is 7.
*/
const checkPrimeFrequency = (nums) => {
  const frequency = nums.reduce((acc, cur) => ((acc[cur] = acc[cur] + 1 || 1), acc), {});

  for (let [key, val] of Object.entries(frequency)) {
    if (val === 2 || val === 3 || val === 5 || val === 7) return true;
    if (val === 1 || val % 2 === 0 || val % 3 === 0 || val % 5 === 0 || val % 7 === 0) continue;
    return true;
  }

  return false;
};
```

  ]);
  const frequency = nums.reduce((acc, cur) => ((acc[cur] = acc[cur] + 1 || 1), acc), {});

**Python**

```python
def checkPrimeFrequency(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
    frequency = Counter(nums)

    for freq in frequency.values():
        if freq == 2 or freq == 3 or freq == 5 or freq == 7: return True
        if freq != 1 and freq % 2 and freq % 3 and freq % 5 and freq % 7: return True

    return False
```

    return any(freq in primes or all(freq % prime for prime in primes) for num, freq in Counter(nums).items() if freq > 1)
