# [2578. Split with Minimum Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/split-with-minimum-sum)

## Description

Given a positive integer `num`, split it into two non-negative integers `num1` and `num2` such that:

- The concatenation of `num1` and `num2` is a permutation of `num`.
  - In other words, the sum of the number of occurrences of each digit in `num1` and `num2` is equal to the number of occurrences of that digit in `num`.
- `num1` and `num2` can contain leading zeros.

Return _the **minimum** possible sum of_ `num1` _and_ `num2`.

**Notes:**

- It is guaranteed that `num` does not contain any leading zeros.
- The order of occurrence of the digits in `num1` and `num2` may differ from the order of occurrence of `num`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** num = 4325  
**Output:** 59  
**Explanation:** We can split 4325 so that `num1` is 24 and `num2` is 35, giving a sum of 59. We can prove that 59 is indeed the minimal possible sum.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** num = 687  
**Output:** 75  
**Explanation:** We can split 687 so that `num1` is 68 and `num2` is 7, which would give an optimal sum of 75.

**Constraints:**

- `10 <= num <= 109`

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
const splitNum = (num) => {
  const sortedDigits = [...`${num}`].sort();
  let num1 = 0;
  let num2 = 0;

  for (let i = 0; i < sortedDigits.length; ++i) {
    if (i % 2) num1 = num1 * 10 + parseInt(sortedDigits[i]);
    else num2 = num2 * 10 + parseInt(sortedDigits[i]);
  }

  return num1 + num2;
};
```

| Time Complexity                      | Space Complexity |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------- |
| O(K \* Log(K), K = number of digits) | O(K)             |
