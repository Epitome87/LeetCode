# [2937. Make Three Strings Equal](https://leetcode.com/problems/make-three-strings-equal)

## Description

You are given three strings: `s1`, `s2`, and `s3`. In one operation you can choose one of these strings and delete its **rightmost** character. Note that you **cannot** completely empty a string.

Return the _minimum number of operations_ required to make the strings equal*.* If it is impossible to make them equal, return `-1`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s1 = "abc", s2 = "abb", s3 = "ab"  
**Output:** 2  
**Explanation:**Â Deleting the rightmost character from both `s1` and `s2` will result in three equal strings.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s1 = "dac", s2 = "bac", s3 = "cac"  
**Output:** \-1  
**Explanation:** Since the first letters of `s1` and `s2` differ, they cannot be made equal.  

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s1.length, s2.length, s3.length <= 100`
- `s1`, `s2` and `s3` consist only of lowercase English letters.

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
// Approach: Just find the length of the longest common prefix, and do appropriate subtraction
const findMinimumOperations = (s1, s2, s3) => {
  const totalStringLength = s1.length + s2.length + s3.length;
  const minStringLength = Math.min(s1.length, s2.length, s3.length);
  let i = 0;

  while (i < minStringLength && s1[i] === s2[i] && s1[i] === s3[i]) {
    ++i;
  }

  return i ? totalStringLength - i * 3 : -1;
};
```
