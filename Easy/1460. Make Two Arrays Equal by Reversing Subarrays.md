# [1460. Make Two Arrays Equal by Reversing Subarrays](https://leetcode.com/problems/make-two-arrays-equal-by-reversing-subarrays)

## Description

You are given two integer arrays of equal length `target` and `arr`. In one step, you can select any **non-empty subarray** of `arr` and reverse it. You are allowed to make any number of steps.

Return `true` _if you can make_ `arr` _equal to_ `target`Â *or* `false` _otherwise_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** target = [1,2,3,4], arr = [2,4,1,3]  
**Output:** true  
**Explanation:** You can follow the next steps to convert arr to target:  
1- Reverse subarray [2,4,1], arr becomes [1,4,2,3]  
2- Reverse subarray [4,2], arr becomes [1,2,4,3]  
3- Reverse subarray [4,3], arr becomes [1,2,3,4]  
There are multiple ways to convert arr to target, this is not the only way to do so.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** target = [7], arr = [7]  
**Output:** true  
**Explanation:** arr is equal to target without any reverses.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** target = [3,7,9], arr = [3,7,11]  
**Output:** false  
**Explanation:** arr does not have value 9 and it can never be converted to target.

**Constraints:**

- `target.length == arr.length`
- `1 <= target.length <= 1000`
- `1 <= target[i] <= 1000`
- `1 <= arr[i] <= 1000`

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
// Approach: Create a hash map for both input arrays to track the frequency of their characters.
// We count the existence of a character in target as positivev and the existence of a character in
// arr as negative. A resulting frequency of 0 means there is an equal amount of that character in
// each array, so we ensure that each value in the map is 0.
const canBeEqual = (target, arr) => {
  const freqMap = {};

  for (let i = 0; i < target.length; ++i) {
    freqMap[target[i]] = (freqMap[target[i]] || 0) + 1;
    freqMap[arr[i]] = (freqMap[arr[i]] || 0) - 1;
  }

  for (let key in freqMap) {
    if (freqMap[key] !== 0) return false;
  }

  return true;
};
```

| Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
| --------------- | ---------------- |
| O(N)            | O(N)             |

```js
// Approach: Create a hash map for both input arrays to track the frequency of their characters
// If they have the same frequency for each element, there exists a way to reverse their subarrays
// to make them equal.
const canBeEqual = (target, arr) => {
  const targetFreq = target.reduce((acc, cur) => ((acc[cur] = acc[cur] + 1 || 1), acc), {});
  const arrFreq = arr.reduce((acc, cur) => ((acc[cur] = acc[cur] + 1 || 1), acc), {});

  for (let key in targetFreq) {
    if (targetFreq[key] !== arrFreq[key]) return false;
  }

  return true;
};
```

| Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
| --------------- | ---------------- |
| O(N)            | O(N)             |

```js
// Sort both arrays, check for equality
const canBeEqual = (target, arr) => target.sort().toString() === arr.sort().toString();
```

| Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
| --------------- | ---------------- |
| O(N \* Log(N))  | O(N)             |
