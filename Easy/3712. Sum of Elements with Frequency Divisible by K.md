# [3712. Sum of Elements with Frequency Divisible by K](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-elements-with-frequency-divisible-by-k)

## Description

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`.

Return an integer denoting the **sum** of all elements in `nums` whose **frequency** is divisible by `k`, or 0 if there are no such elements.

**Note:** An element is included in the sum **exactly** as many times as it appears in the array if its total frequency is divisible by `k`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,2,2,3,3,3,3,4\], k = 2

**Output:** 16

**Explanation:**

- The number 1 appears once (odd frequency).
- The number 2 appears twice (even frequency).
- The number 3 appears four times (even frequency).
- The number 4 appears once (odd frequency).

So, the total sum is `2 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 16`.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,2,3,4,5\], k = 2

**Output:** 0

**Explanation:**

There are no elements that appear an even number of times, so the total sum is 0.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = \[4,4,4,1,2,3\], k = 3

**Output:** 12

**Explanation:**

- The number 1 appears once.
- The number 2 appears once.
- The number 3 appears once.
- The number 4 appears three times.

So, the total sum is `4 + 4 + 4 = 12`.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 100`
- `1 <= k <= 100`

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
const sumDivisibleByK = (nums, k) => {
  const freq = nums.reduce((acc, cur) => ((acc[cur] = acc[cur] + 1 || 1), acc), {});
  const sum = Object.entries(freq).reduce((acc, [key, val]) => acc + (val % k ? 0 : key * val), 0);
  return sum;
};
```

```js
const sumDivisibleByK = (nums, k) => {
  const freq = {};

  for (let num of nums) {
    freq[num] = freq[num] + 1 || 1;
  }

  let sum = 0;

  for (key in freq) {
    if (freq[key] % k === 0) sum += key * freq[key];
  }

  return sum;
};
```

| --------------- | ---------------- |
| O(N)            | O(N)             |

**Python**

```python
def sumDivisibleByK(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
    freq = {}

    for num in nums:
        freq[num] = freq.get(num, 0) + 1

    sum = 0
    for key in freq:
        if freq[key] % k == 0:
            sum += key * freq[key]

    return sum
```

| O(N)            | O(N)             |
