# [1051. Height Checker](https://leetcode.com/problems/height-checker)

## Description

A school is trying to take an annual photo of all the students. The students are asked to stand in a single file line in **non-decreasing order** by height. Let this ordering be represented by the integer array `expected` where `expected[i]` is the expected height of the `ith` student in line.

You are given an integer array `heights` representing the **current order** that the students are standing in. Each `heights[i]` is the height of the `ith` student in line (**0-indexed**).

Return _the **number of indices** where_ `heights[i] != expected[i]`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** heights = [1,1,4,2,1,3]  
**Output:** 3  
**Explanation:**  
heights: [1,1,4,2,1,3]  
expected: [1,1,1,2,3,4]  
Indices 2, 4, and 5 do not match.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** heights = [5,1,2,3,4]  
**Output:** 5  
**Explanation:**  
heights: [5,1,2,3,4]  
expected: [1,2,3,4,5]  
All indices do not match.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** heights = [1,2,3,4,5]  
**Output:** 0  
**Explanation:**  
heights: [1,2,3,4,5]  
expected: [1,2,3,4,5]  
All indices match.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= heights.length <= 100`
- `1 <= heights[i] <= 100`

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
// Approach 2: Using Count Sort
const heightChecker = (heights) => {
  // We are told the heights range from 1-100
  const bucket = new Array(101).fill(0);

  // So let's count the occurrence of each possible 100 heights!
  for (let height of heights) {
    bucket[height]++;
  }

  let result = 0;
  let index = 0;

  // And now let's see how many times heights[i] !== expected[i]
  for (let i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
    while (bucket[i] > 0) {
      // Could also re-write the while as: for (let j = 0; j < bucket[i]; j++)
      if (i !== heights[index++]) result++;
      bucket[i]--;
    }
  }

  return result;
};
```

| Time Complexity    | Space Complexity |
| ------------------ | ---------------- |
| O(N + 100) => O(N) | O(101) => O(1)   |

```js
// Approach 1: Sorting the heights
const heightChecker = (heights) => {
  const expectedHeights = [...heights].sort((a, b) => a - b);
  return heights.reduce((acc, cur, idx) => acc + (expectedHeights[idx] !== cur), 0);
};
```

| Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
| --------------- | ---------------- |
| O(N \* Log N)   | O(N)             |
