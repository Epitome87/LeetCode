# [2027. Minimum Moves to Convert String](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-moves-to-convert-string)

## Description

You are given a string `s` consisting of `n` characters which are either `'X'` or `'O'`.

A **move** is defined as selecting **three** **consecutive characters** of `s` and converting them to `'O'`. Note that if a move is applied to the character `'O'`, it will stay the **same**.

Return _the **minimum** number of moves required so that all the characters of_ `s` _are converted to_ `'O'`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "XXX"  
**Output:** 1  
**Explanation:** XXX -> OOO  
We select all the 3 characters and convert them in one move.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "XXOX"  
**Output:** 2  
**Explanation:** XXOX -> OOOX -> OOOO  
We select the first 3 characters in the first move, and convert them to `'O'`.  
Then we select the last 3 characters and convert them so that the final string contains all `'O'`s.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s = "OOOO"  
**Output:** 0  
**Explanation:** There are no `'X's` in `s` to convert.

**Constraints:**

- `3 <= s.length <= 1000`
- `s[i]` is either `'X'` or `'O'`.

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
const minimumMoves = (s) => {
  let result = 0;

  for (let i = 0; i < s.length; ++i) {
    // We only want to 'move' when we encounter an X
    if (s[i] === 'X') {
      ++result;
      // Each 'move' converts this and the next 2 characters
      // So we can advance i by 3 (2 in the statement below and 1 in the for-loop)
      i += 2;
    }
  }

  return result;
};
```
