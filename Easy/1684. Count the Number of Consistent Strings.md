# [1684. Count the Number of Consistent Strings](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-the-number-of-consistent-strings)

## Description

You are given a string `allowed` consisting of **distinct** characters and an array of strings `words`. A string is **consistent** if all characters in the string appear in the string `allowed`.

Return _the number of **consistent** strings in the array_ `words`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** allowed = "ab", words = \["ad","bd","aaab","baa","badab"\]  
**Output:** 2  
**Explanation:** Strings "aaab" and "baa" are consistent since they only contain characters 'a' and 'b'.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** allowed = "abc", words = \["a","b","c","ab","ac","bc","abc"\]  
**Output:** 7  
**Explanation:** All strings are consistent.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** allowed = "cad", words = \["cc","acd","b","ba","bac","bad","ac","d"\]  
**Output:** 4  
**Explanation:** Strings "cc", "acd", "ac", and "d" are consistent.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= words.length <= 104`
- `1 <= allowed.length <= 26`
- `1 <= words[i].length <= 10`
- The characters in `allowed` are **distinct**.
- `words[i]` and `allowed` contain only lowercase English letters.

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
const countConsistentStrings = (allowed, words) => {
  const allowedSet = new Set(allowed);
  let count = 0;

  for (let word of words) {
    for (let char of word) {
      if (!allowedSet.has(char)) {
        count++;
        break;
      }
    }
  }

  return words.length - count;
};
```

| Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
| --------------- | ---------------- |
| O(N)            | O(N)             |

```js
const countConsistentStrings = (allowed, words) => {
  let count = 0;

  for (let word of words) {
    for (let char of word) {
      if (!allowed.includes(char)) {
        count++;
        break;
      }
    }
  }

  return words.length - count;
};
```

| Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
| --------------- | ---------------- |
| O(N^2)          | O(1)             |
