# [1217. Minimum Cost to Move Chips to the Same Position](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-cost-to-move-chips-to-the-same-position)

## Description

We have `n` chips, where the position of the `ith` chip is `position[i]`.

We need to move all the chips to **the same position**. In one step, we can change the position of the `ith` chip from `position[i]` to:

- `position[i] + 2` or `position[i] - 2` with `cost = 0`.
- `position[i] + 1` or `position[i] - 1` with `cost = 1`.

Return _the minimum cost_ needed to move all the chips to the same position.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/08/15/chips_e1.jpg)

**Input:** position = \[1,2,3\]  
**Output:** 1  
**Explanation:** First step: Move the chip at position 3 to position 1 with cost = 0.  
Second step: Move the chip at position 2 to position 1 with cost = 1.  
Total cost is 1.

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/08/15/chip_e2.jpg)

**Input:** position = \[2,2,2,3,3\]  
**Output:** 2  
**Explanation:** We can move the two chips at position 3 to position 2. Each move has cost = 1. The total cost = 2.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** position = \[1,1000000000\]  
**Output:** 1

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= position.length <= 100`
- `1 <= position[i] <= 10^9`

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
// Approach: We can simply count how many chips are at even indices and how many
// are at odd ones. The result is the smaller of these two values. This is because
// we can move chips for free to other positions of the same parity. We choose to move
// the positions with the most-frequent parity two spaces (thus a free cost). The chips
// remaining will be the other parity -- the less-frequent parity!
const minCostToMoveChips = (position) => {
  let odd = 0;
  let even = 0;

  for (let pos of position) {
    if (pos % 2) ++odd;
    else ++even;
  }

  return Math.min(odd, even);
};
```

**Python**

```python
def minCostToMoveChips(position: List[int]) -> int:
    odd = 0
    even = 0

    for pos in position:
        if pos % 2: odd += 1
        else: even += 1

    return min(odd, even)
```

    return min(sum(pos % 2 for pos in position), sum(pos % 2 == 0 for pos in position))
