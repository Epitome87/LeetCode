# [2848. Points that Intersect with Cars](https://leetcode.com/problems/points-that-intersect-with-cars)

## Description

You are given a **0-indexed** 2D integer array `nums` representing the coordinates of the cars parking on a number line. For any index `i`, `nums[i] = [starti, endi]` where `starti` is the starting point of the `ith` car and `endi` is the ending point of the `ith` car.

Return _the number of integer points on the line that are covered with **any part** of a car._

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[\[3,6\],\[1,5\],\[4,7\]\]  
**Output:** 7  
**Explanation:** All the points from 1 to 7 intersect at least one car, therefore the answer would be 7.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[\[1,3\],\[5,8\]\]  
**Output:** 7  
**Explanation:** Points intersecting at least one car are 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8. There are a total of 7 points, therefore the answer would be 7.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
- `nums[i].length == 2`
- `1 <= starti <= endi <= 100`

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
// Approach: Line Sweep
const numberOfPoints = (nums) => {
  const line = new Array(102).fill(0);
  let result = 0;
  let sum = 0;

  for (let [start, end] of nums) {
    // Mark the start of a parked car
    ++line[start];

    // Mark the ending (+1 to represent first free spot after parked car)
    --line[end + 1];
  }

  for (let i = 1; i <= 101; ++i) {
    line[i] += line[i - 1];
    // Positive values represent points that are covered by a car
    if (line[i] > 0) ++result;
  }

  return result;
};
```

| Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
| --------------- | ---------------- |
| O(N)            | O(1)             |

```js
// Approach: Brute-Force
// Time Complexity: N * k, where N is input array and k = average of nums[1] - nums[0] + 1 for each element in nums
const numberOfPoints = (nums) => {
  let result = 0;
  const line = new Array(101).fill(0);

  for (let [start, end] of nums) {
    for (let i = start; i <= end; ++i) {
      line[i]++;
    }
  }

  for (let n of line) {
    if (n > 0) ++result;
  }

  return result;
};
```
