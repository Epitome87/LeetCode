# [3370. Smallest Number With All Set Bits](https://leetcode.com/problems/smallest-number-with-all-set-bits)

## Description

You are given a _positive_ number `n`.

Return the **smallest** number `x` **greater than** or **equal to** `n`, such that the binary representation of `x` contains only

set bits

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 5  
**Output:** 7  
**Explanation:**  
The binary representation of 7 is `"111"`.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 10  
**Output:** 15  
**Explanation:**  
The binary representation of 15 is `"1111"`.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** n = 3  
**Output:** 3  
**Explanation:**  
The binary representation of 3 is `"11"`.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 1000`

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
/*
Approach: We note that numbers with only 1 in their binary are of the form 2^b - 1, where b
is the total number of bits.
The smallest number greater than or equal to n will have b bits, where b = log(n) + 1
*/
const smallestNumber = (n) => {
  // Number of bits in n
  const b = Math.floor(Math.log2(n)) + 1;

  // Return 2^b - 1, which consists of all 1's
  return (1 << b) - 1;
};
```

```js
// Approach: Same as above, but assume we only have Math.log and not Math.log2 formula.
const smallestNumber = (n) => {
  // Number of bits in n
  const b = Math.floor(Math.log(n) / Math.log(2)) + 1;

  // Return 2^b - 1, which consists of all 1's
  return (1 << b) - 1;
};
```
