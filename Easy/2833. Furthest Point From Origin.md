# [2833. Furthest Point From Origin](https://leetcode.com/problems/furthest-point-from-origin)

## Description

You are given a string `moves` of length `n` consisting only of characters `'L'`, `'R'`, and `'_'`. The string represents your movement on a number line starting from the origin `0`.

In the `ith` move, you can choose one of the following directions:

- move to the left if `moves[i] = 'L'` or `moves[i] = '_'`
- move to the right if `moves[i] = 'R'` or `moves[i] = '_'`

Return _the **distance from the origin** of the **furthest** point you can get to after_ `n` _moves_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** moves = "L_RL\_\_R"  
**Output:** 3  
**Explanation:** The furthest point we can reach from the origin 0 is point -3 through the following sequence of moves "LLRLLLR".

**Example 2:**

**Input:** moves = "\_R\_\_LL\_"  
**Output:** 5  
**Explanation:** The furthest point we can reach from the origin 0 is point -5 through the following sequence of moves "LRLLLLL".

**Example 3:**

**Input:** moves = "\_\_\_\_\_\_\_"  
**Output:** 7  
**Explanation:** The furthest point we can reach from the origin 0 is point 7 through the following sequence of moves "RRRRRRR".

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= moves.length == n <= 50`
- `moves` consists only of characters `'L'`, `'R'` and `'_'`.

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
// Just find the difference between number of 'L' and 'R'
// Then add to that the total number of '_'
const furthestDistanceFromOrigin = (moves) => {
  let distanceA = 0;
  let distanceB = 0;

  for (let move of moves) {
    if (move === 'L') ++distanceA;
    else if (move === 'R') --distanceA;
    else ++distanceB;
  }

  return Math.abs(distanceA) + distanceB;
};
```

**Python**

```py
def furthestDistanceFromOrigin(moves: str) -> int:
    return abs(moves.count('L') - moves.count('R')) + moves.count('_')
```
