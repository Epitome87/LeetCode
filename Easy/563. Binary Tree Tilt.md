# [563. Binary Tree Tilt](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-tilt)

## Description

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return _the sum of every tree node's **tilt**._

The **tilt** of a tree node is the **absolute difference** between the sum of all left subtree node **values** and all right subtree node **values**. If a node does not have a left child, then the sum of the left subtree node **values** is treated as `0`. The rule is similar if the node does not have a right child.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** root = \[1,2,3\]  
**Output:** 1  
**Explanation:**  
Tilt of node 2 : |0-0| = 0 (no children)  
Tilt of node 3 : |0-0| = 0 (no children)  
Tilt of node 1 : |2-3| = 1 (left subtree is just left child, so sum is 2; right subtree is just right child, so sum is 3)  
Sum of every tilt : 0 + 0 + 1 = 1

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/20/tilt2.jpg)

**Input:** root = \[4,2,9,3,5,null,7\]  
**Output:** 15  
**Explanation:**  
Tilt of node 3 : |0-0| = 0 (no children)  
Tilt of node 5 : |0-0| = 0 (no children)  
Tilt of node 7 : |0-0| = 0 (no children)  
Tilt of node 2 : |3-5| = 2 (left subtree is just left child, so sum is 3; right subtree is just right child, so sum is 5)  
Tilt of node 9 : |0-7| = 7 (no left child, so sum is 0; right subtree is just right child, so sum is 7)  
Tilt of node 4 : |(3+5+2)-(9+7)| = |10-16| = 6 (left subtree values are 3, 5, and 2, which sums to 10; right subtree values are 9 and 7, which sums to 16)  
Sum of every tilt : 0 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 7 + 6 = 15

**Example 3:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/20/tilt3.jpg)

**Input:** root = \[21,7,14,1,1,2,2,3,3\]
**Output:** 9

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 10^4]`.
- `-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
// Approach: Perform a DFS to perform a left and right child sum for each subtree,
// incrementing our result as we visit each node
const findTilt = (root) => {
  let result = 0;

  const sum = (node) => {
    if (!node) return 0;
    const leftSum = sum(node.left);
    const rightSum = sum(node.right);
    result += Math.abs(leftSum - rightSum);
    return node.val + leftSum + rightSum;
  };

  sum(root);
  return result;
};
```
