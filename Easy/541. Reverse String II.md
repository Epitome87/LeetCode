# [541. Reverse String II](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-string-ii)

## Description

Given a string `s` and an integer `k`, reverse the first `k` characters for every `2k` characters counting from the start of the string.

If there are fewer than `k` characters left, reverse all of them. If there are less than `2k` but greater than or equal to `k` characters, then reverse the first `k` characters and leave the other as original.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "abcdefg", k = 2  
**Output:** "bacdfeg"

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "abcd", k = 2  
**Output:** "bacd"

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 10^4`
- `s` consists of only lowercase English letters.
- `1 <= k <= 10^4`

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
const reverseStr = (s, k) => {
  const result = [...s];

  for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i += 2 * k) {
    for (let left = i, right = i + k - 1; left < right; left++, right--) {
      [result[left], result[right]] = [result[right], result[left]];
    }
  }

  return result.join('');
};
```
