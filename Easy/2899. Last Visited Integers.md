# [2899. Last Visited Integers](https://leetcode.com/problems/last-visited-integers)

## Description

Given an integer array `nums` where `nums[i]` is either a positive integer or `-1`. We need to find for each `-1` the respective positive integer, which we call the last visited integer.

To achieve this goal, let's define two empty arrays: `seen` and `ans`.

Start iterating from the beginning of the array `nums`.

- If a positive integer is encountered, prepend it to the **front** of `seen`.
- If `-1` is encountered, let `k` be the number of **consecutive** `-1`s seen so far (including the current `-1`),
  - If `k` is less than or equal to the length of `seen`, append the `k`\-th element of `seen` to `ans`.
  - If `k` is strictly greater than the length of `seen`, append `-1` to `ans`.

Return the array `ans`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,2,-1,-1,-1\]  
**Output:** \[2,1,-1\]  
**Explanation:**  
Start with `seen = []` and `ans = []`.

1.  Process `nums[0]`: The first element in nums is `1`. We prepend it to the front of `seen`. Now, `seen == [1]`.
2.  Process `nums[1]`: The next element is `2`. We prepend it to the front of `seen`. Now, `seen == [2, 1]`.
3.  Process `nums[2]`: The next element is `-1`. This is the first occurrence of `-1`, so `k == 1`. We look for the first element in seen. We append `2` to `ans`. Now, `ans == [2]`.
4.  Process `nums[3]`: Another `-1`. This is the second consecutive `-1`, so `k == 2`. The second element in `seen` is `1`, so we append `1` to `ans`. Now, `ans == [2, 1]`.
5.  Process `nums[4]`: Another `-1`, the third in a row, making `k = 3`. However, `seen` only has two elements (`[2, 1]`). Since `k` is greater than the number of elements in `seen`, we append `-1` to `ans`. Finally, `ans == [2, 1, -1]`.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,-1,2,-1,-1\]  
**Output:** \[1,2,1\]  
**Explanation:**  
Start with `seen = []` and `ans = []`.

1.  Process `nums[0]`: The first element in nums is `1`. We prepend it to the front of `seen`. Now, `seen == [1]`.
2.  Process `nums[1]`: The next element is `-1`. This is the first occurrence of `-1`, so `k == 1`. We look for the first element in `seen`, which is `1`. Append `1` to `ans`. Now, `ans == [1]`.
3.  Process `nums[2]`: The next element is `2`. Prepend this to the front of `seen`. Now, `seen == [2, 1]`.
4.  Process `nums[3]`: The next element is `-1`. This `-1` is not consecutive to the first `-1` since `2` was in between. Thus, `k` resets to `1`. The first element in `seen` is `2`, so append `2` to `ans`. Now, `ans == [1, 2]`.
5.  Process `nums[4]`: Another `-1`. This is consecutive to the previous `-1`, so `k == 2`. The second element in `seen` is `1`, append `1` to `ans`. Finally, `ans == [1, 2, 1]`.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
- `nums[i] == -1` or `1 <= nums[i] <= 100`

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
const lastVisitedIntegers = (nums) => {
  let k = 0;
  const seen = [];
  const ans = [];

  for (const num of nums) {
    if (num >= 0) {
      seen.unshift(num);
      k = 0;
    } else if (num === -1) {
      ++k;
      if (k <= seen.length) ans.push(seen[k - 1]);
      else ans.push(-1);
    }
  }

  return ans;
};
```

**Python**

```python
def lastVisitedIntegers(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    k = 0
    seen = []
    ans = []

    for num in nums:
        if num >= 0:
            seen.insert(0, num)
            k = 0
        elif num == -1:
            k += 1
            if k <= len(seen): ans.append(seen[k - 1])
            else: ans.append(-1)

    return ans
```
