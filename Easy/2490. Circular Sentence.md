# [2490. Circular Sentence](https://leetcode.com/problems/circular-sentence)

## Description

A **sentence** is a list of words that are separated by a **single** space with no leading or trailing spaces.

- For example, `"Hello World"`, `"HELLO"`, `"hello world hello world"` are all sentences.

Words consist of **only** uppercase and lowercase English letters. Uppercase and lowercase English letters are considered different.

A sentence is **circular** if:

- The last character of each word in the sentence is equal to the first character of its next word.
- The last character of the last word is equal to the first character of the first word.

For example, `"leetcode exercises sound delightful"`, `"eetcode"`, `"leetcode eats soul"` are all circular sentences. However, `"Leetcode is cool"`, `"happy Leetcode"`, `"Leetcode"` and `"I like Leetcode"` are **not** circular sentences.

Given a string `sentence`, return `true` _if it is circular_. Otherwise, return `false`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** sentence = "leetcode exercises sound delightful"  
**Output:** true  
**Explanation:** The words in sentence are \["leetcode", "exercises", "sound", "delightful"\].

- leetcode's last character is equal to exercises's first character.
- exercises's last character is equal to sound's first character.
- sound's last character is equal to delightful's first character.
- delightful's last character is equal to leetcode's first character.  
  The sentence is circular.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** sentence = "eetcode"  
**Output:** true  
**Explanation:** The words in sentence are \["eetcode"\].

- eetcode's last character is equal to eetcode's first character.  
  The sentence is circular.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** sentence = "Leetcode is cool"  
**Output:** false  
**Explanation:** The words in sentence are \["Leetcode", "is", "cool"\].

- Leetcode's last character is **not** equal to is's first character.  
  The sentence is **not** circular.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= sentence.length <= 500`
- `sentence` consist of only lowercase and uppercase English letters and spaces.
- The words in `sentence` are separated by a single space.
- There are no leading or trailing spaces.

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
// Approach: Avoiding built-in methods
const isCircularSentence = (sentence) => {
  const n = sentence.length;

  // First check: Compare first and last character of sentence
  if (sentence[0] !== sentence[n - 1]) return false;

  // Iterate through the sentence, starting from index 1 to n - 2
  for (let i = 1; i < n - 1; i++) {
    // When we find a space character...
    if (sentence[i] === ' ') {
      // Check if the character before space matches the character after space
      if (sentence[i - 1] !== sentence[i + 1]) return false;
    }
  }

  // If we made it through all checks, the sentence is circular!
  return true;
};
```

| --------------- | ---------------- |
| O(N)            | O(1)             |

```js
// Approach: Using .split to separate sentence into words
const isCircularSentence = (sentence) => {
  const words = sentence.split(' ');

  for (let i = 0; i < words.length; ++i) {
    if (words[i].at(-1) !== words[(i + 1) % words.length][0]) return false;
  }

  return true;
};
```
