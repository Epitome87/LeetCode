# [2389. Longest Subsequence with Limited Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-subsequence-with-limited-sum)

## Description

You are given an integer array `nums` of length `n`, and an integer array `queries` of length `m`.

Return _an array_ `answer` _of length_ `m` _where_ `answer[i]` _is the **maximum** size of a **subsequence** that you can take from_ `nums` _such that the **sum** of its elements is less than or equal to_ `queries[i]`.

A **subsequence** is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[4,5,2,1\], queries = \[3,10,21\]  
**Output:** \[2,3,4\]  
**Explanation:** We answer the queries as follows:

- The subsequence \[2,1\] has a sum less than or equal to 3. It can be proven that 2 is the maximum size of such a subsequence, so answer\[0\] = 2.
- The subsequence \[4,5,1\] has a sum less than or equal to 10. It can be proven that 3 is the maximum size of such a subsequence, so answer\[1\] = 3.
- The subsequence \[4,5,2,1\] has a sum less than or equal to 21. It can be proven that 4 is the maximum size of such a subsequence, so answer\[2\] = 4.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[2,3,4,5\], queries = \[1\]  
**Output:** \[0\]  
**Explanation:** The empty subsequence is the only subsequence that has a sum less than or equal to 1, so answer\[0\] = 0.

**Constraints:**

- `n == nums.length`
- `m == queries.length`
- `1 <= n, m <= 1000`
- `1 <= nums[i], queries[i] <= 10^6`

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
// Approach: Calculate prefix sum for each num on sorted input
// Then use binary search to efficiently solve each query
const answerQueries = (nums, queries) => {
  const result = [];
  const sortedNums = nums.toSorted((a, b) => a - b);

  // Calculate prefix sum at each index
  for (let i = 1; i < sortedNums.length; ++i) {
    sortedNums[i] += sortedNums[i - 1];
  }

  // For each query, perform a binary search to quickly find
  // the index at which the query sum occurs at.
  for (let i = 0; i < queries.length; ++i) {
    result[i] = binarySearch(sortedNums, queries[i]);
  }

  return result;
};

const binarySearch = (nums, target) => {
  let left = 0;
  let right = nums.length;

  while (left < right) {
    let middle = left + Math.floor((right - left) / 2);
    if (nums[middle] <= target) left = middle + 1;
    else right = middle;
  }

  return left;
};
```

| Time Complexity    | Space Complexity |
| ------------------ | ---------------- |
| O(M \* Log(N) + N) | O(N)             |

```js
// Approach: Sort and Brute-Force
// Time Complexity: O(N * M), N = nums.length, M = queries.length
const answerQueries = (nums, queries) => {
  const result = [];
  const sortedNums = nums.toSorted((a, b) => a - b);

  for (let query of queries) {
    let count = 0;
    let sum = 0;

    for (let i = 0; i < sortedNums.length, sum <= query; ++i) {
      sum += sortedNums[i];
      if (sum <= query) ++count;
    }

    result.push(count);
  }

  return result;
};
```
