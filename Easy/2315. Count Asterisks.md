# [2315. Count Asterisks](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-asterisks)

## Description

You are given a string `s`, where every **two** consecutive vertical bars `'|'` are grouped into a **pair**. In other words, the 1st and 2nd `'|'` make a pair, the 3rd and 4th `'|'` make a pair, and so forth.

Return _the number of_ `'*'` _in_ `s`_, **excluding** the_ `'*'` _between each pair of_ `'|'`.

**Note** that each `'|'` will belong to **exactly** one pair.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "l|\*e\*et|c\*\*o|\*de|"  
**Output:** 2  
**Explanation:** The considered characters are underlined: "l|\*e\*et|c\*\*o|\*de|".
The characters between the first and second '|' are excluded from the answer.
Also, the characters between the third and fourth '|' are excluded from the answer.
There are 2 asterisks considered. Therefore, we return 2.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "iamprogrammer"  
**Output:** 0  
**Explanation:** In this example, there are no asterisks in s. Therefore, we return 0.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s = "yo|uar|e\*\*|b|e\*\*\*au|tifu|l"  
**Output:** 5  
**Explanation:** The considered characters are underlined: "yo|uar|e\*\*|b|e\*\*\*au|tifu|l". There are 5 asterisks considered. Therefore, we return 5.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
- `s` consists of lowercase English letters, vertical bars `'|'`, and asterisks `'*'`.
- `s` contains an **even** number of vertical bars `'|'`.

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
const countAsterisks = function (s) {
  let isCountable = true;
  let result = 0;

  for (let char of s) {
    if (isCountable && char === '*') result++;
    if (char === '|') isCountable = !isCountable;
  }

  return result;
};
```

**Python**

```py
class Solution:
    def countAsterisks(self, s: str) -> int:
        result = 0
        is_countable = True

        for c in s:
            if c == '|':
                is_countable = not is_countable
            if c == '*' and is_countable:
                result += 1

        return result
```
