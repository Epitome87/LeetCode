# [2399. Check Distances Between Same Letters](https://leetcode.com/problems/check-distances-between-same-letters)

## Description

You are given a **0-indexed** string `s` consisting of only lowercase English letters, where each letter in `s` appears **exactly** **twice**. You are also given a **0-indexed** integer array `distance` of length `26`.

Each letter in the alphabet is numbered from `0` to `25` (i.e. `'a' -> 0`, `'b' -> 1`, `'c' -> 2`, ... , `'z' -> 25`).

In a **well-spaced** string, the number of letters between the two occurrences of the `ith` letter is `distance[i]`. If the `ith` letter does not appear in `s`, then `distance[i]` can be **ignored**.

Return `true` _if_ `s` _is a **well-spaced** string, otherwise return_ `false`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "abaccb", distance = \[1,3,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\]  
**Output:** true  
**Explanation:**

- 'a' appears at indices 0 and 2 so it satisfies distance\[0\] = 1.
- 'b' appears at indices 1 and 5 so it satisfies distance\[1\] = 3.
- 'c' appears at indices 3 and 4 so it satisfies distance\[2\] = 0.  
  Note that distance\[3\] = 5, but since 'd' does not appear in s, it can be ignored.  
  Return true because s is a well-spaced string.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "aa", distance = \[1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\]  
**Output:** false  
**Explanation:**

- 'a' appears at indices 0 and 1 so there are zero letters between them.  
  Because distance\[0\] = 1, s is not a well-spaced string.

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= s.length <= 52`
- `s` consists only of lowercase English letters.
- Each letter appears in `s` exactly twice.
- `distance.length == 26`
- `0 <= distance[i] <= 50`

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
const checkDistances = (s, distance) => {
  const position = new Array(26).fill(null);

  for (let i = 0; i < s.length; ++i) {
    const n = s[i].charCodeAt() - 97;
    if (position[n] !== null) {
      const dist = i - position[n] - 1;
      if (distance[n] !== dist) return false;
    } else position[n] = i;
  }

  return true;
};
```

      const idx = s[i].charCodeAt() - 97;

    } else map[s[i]] = i;
  }

  return true;
