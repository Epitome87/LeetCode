# [836. Rectangle Overlap](https://leetcode.com/problems/rectangle-overlap)

## Description

An axis-aligned rectangle is represented as a list `[x1, y1, x2, y2]`, where `(x1, y1)` is the coordinate of its bottom-left corner, and `(x2, y2)` is the coordinate of its top-right corner. Its top and bottom edges are parallel to the X-axis, and its left and right edges are parallel to the Y-axis.

Two rectangles overlap if the area of their intersection is **positive**. To be clear, two rectangles that only touch at the corner or edges do not overlap.

Given two axis-aligned rectangles `rec1` and `rec2`, return `true` _if they overlap, otherwise return_ `false`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** rec1 = \[0,0,2,2\], rec2 = \[1,1,3,3\]  
**Output:** true

**Example 2:**

**Input:** rec1 = \[0,0,1,1\], rec2 = \[1,0,2,1\]  
**Output:** false

**Example 3:**

**Input:** rec1 = \[0,0,1,1\], rec2 = \[2,2,3,3\]  
**Output:** false

**Constraints:**

- `rec1.length == 4`
- `rec2.length == 4`
- `-109 <= rec1[i], rec2[i] <= 10^9`
- `rec1` and `rec2` represent a valid rectangle with a non-zero area.

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
// Check by identifying cases where rectangles DO NOT overlap, then negating all that
// NOT(Rec1 to the right side of Rec2 OR Rec1 to the left side of Rec2 OR Rec1 above Rec2 OR Rec1 below Rec2)
const isRectangleOverlap = (rec1, rec2) =>
  !(rec1[0] >= rec2[2] || rec2[0] >= rec1[2] || rec1[1] >= rec2[3] || rec2[1] >= rec1[3]);
```

```js
// Rec1's left side is to the left of Rec2's right side AND Rec2's left side is to the left of Rec1's right side AND
// Rec1's bottom side is below Rec2's top side AND Rec2's bottom side is below Rec1's top side
const isRectangleOverlap = (rec1, rec2) =>
  rec1[0] < rec2[2] && rec2[0] < rec1[2] && rec1[1] < rec2[3] && rec2[1] < rec1[3];
```

```js
const isRectangleOverlap = (rec1, rec2) => {
  const start1 = Math.max(rec1[0], rec2[0]);
  const end1 = Math.min(rec1[2], rec2[2]);

  const start2 = Math.max(rec1[1], rec2[1]);
  const end2 = Math.min(rec1[3], rec2[3]);

  return start1 < end1 && start2 < end2;
};
```
