# [136. Single Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number)

## Description

Given a **non-empty** array of integers `nums`, every element appears _twice_ except for one. Find that single one.

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [2,2,1]  
**Output:** 1

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [4,1,2,1,2]  
**Output:** 4

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = [1]  
**Output:** 1

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 10^4`
- `-3 * 10^4 <= nums[i] <= 3 * 10^4`
- Each element in the array appears twice except for one element which appears only once.

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
/*
Approach: Bit manipulation
Use Bitwise XOR -- it results in 1 if both bit are different (a !== b)
Although it may be difficult to understand why, the order of performing this operation
over each number in the array does not matter. In the end, all bits from duplicate nums
will turn into 0, while all the bits in the unique number remain one. This leaves us
with the binary of our result number.
*/
const singleNumber = (nums) => nums.reduce((acc, cur) => acc ^ cur);

const singleNumber = (nums) => {
  let result = 0;

  for (let num of nums) {
    result = result ^ num;
  }

  return result;
};
```

| Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
| --------------- | ---------------- |
| O(N)            | O(1)             |

```js
/*
Approach: Iterate through each number, mapping that number with how many times it occurs.
Iterate again through that map, returning the key with the value of 1
*/
const singleNumber = (nums) => {
  const counts = nums.reduce((acc, cur) => ((acc[cur] = acc[cur] + 1 || 1), acc), {});
  for (let [key, val] of Object.entries(counts)) {
    if (val === 1) return +key;
  }
};
```
