# [100. Same Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/same-tree)

## Description

Given the roots of two binary trees `p` and `q`, write a function to check if they are the same or not.

Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical, and the nodes have the same value.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: p = [1,2,3], q = [1,2,3]
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: p = [1,2], q = [1,null,2]
Output: false
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: p = [1,2,1], q = [1,1,2]
Output: false
```

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in both trees is in the range [0, 100].
- -10<sup>4</sup> <= Node.val <= 10<sup>4</sup>

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
var isSameTree = function (p, q) {
  // If both nodes are null, they are identical
  if (!p && !q) return true;

  // Neither node is null, and they are equal...
  if (p && q && p.val === q.val) {
    // That means I'm identical, but are my children?
    const isLeftSame = isSameTree(p.left, q.left);
    const isRightSame = isSameTree(p.right, q.right);

    return isLeftSame && isRightSame;
  }

  // If only one node is null, or the values are different,
  // they aren't identical
  return false;
};
```
