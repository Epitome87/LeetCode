# [1984. Minimum Difference Between Highest and Lowest K Scores](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-difference-between-highest-and-lowest-of-k-scores)

## Description

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums`, where `nums[i]` represents the score of the `ith` student. You are also given an integer `k`.

Pick the scores of any `k` students from the array so that the **difference** between the **highest** and the **lowest** of the `k` scores is **minimized**.

Return _the **minimum** possible difference_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[90\], k = 1  
**Output:** 0  
**Explanation:** There is one way to pick score(s) of one student:

- \[**90**\]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 90 - 90 = 0.
  The minimum possible difference is 0.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[9,4,1,7\], k = 2  
**Output:** 2  
**Explanation:** There are six ways to pick score(s) of two students:

- \[**9**,**4**,1,7\]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 9 - 4 = 5.
- \[**9**,4,**1**,7\]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 9 - 1 = 8.
- \[**9**,4,1,**7**\]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 9 - 7 = 2.
- \[9,**4**,**1**,7\]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 4 - 1 = 3.
- \[9,**4**,1,**7**\]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 7 - 4 = 3.
- \[9,4,**1**,**7**\]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 7 - 1 = 6.
  The minimum possible difference is 2.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= k <= nums.length <= 1000`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
/*
Approach: Sort and use a fixed-size Sliding Window.
The right of the window will have the max value of that window, while the
left of it will have the minimum. Calculate the difference between the two
and keep track of the smallest delta visited.
*/
const minimumDifference = (nums, k) => {
  const sorted = nums.toSorted((a, b) => a - b);
  let result = Infinity;

  for (let i = 0; i <= sorted.length - k; i++) {
    // The difference between the max (element k - 1 indices away from curent)
    // and the the minimum (current element)
    const delta = sorted[i + k - 1] - sorted[i];

    // Update the minimum delta seen so far, if necessary
    result = Math.min(result, delta);
  }

  return result;
};
```
