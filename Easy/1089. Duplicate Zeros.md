# [1089. Duplicate Zeros](https://leetcode.com/problems/duplicate-zeros)

## Description

Given a fixed-length integer array `arr`, duplicate each occurrence of zero, shifting the remaining elements to the right.

**Note** that elements beyond the length of the original array are not written. Do the above modifications to the input array in place and do not return anything.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** arr = \[1,0,2,3,0,4,5,0\]  
**Output:** \[1,0,0,2,3,0,0,4\]  
**Explanation:** After calling your function, the input array is modified to: \[1,0,0,2,3,0,0,4\]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** arr = \[1,2,3\]  
**Output:** \[1,2,3\]  
**Explanation:** After calling your function, the input array is modified to: \[1,2,3\]

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= arr.length <= 10^4`
- `0 <= arr[i] <= 9`

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
// Approach: Same as below, just more concise
const duplicateZeros = (arr) => {
  const n = arr.length;

  // How many 0's are there in the input array?
  const numZero = arr.reduce((acc, cur) => acc + (cur === 0), 0);

  // Set j to the length of input array plus the number of zeros
  let j = n + numZero;

  // Iterate the input array in reverse
  for (let i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    if (--j < n) arr[j] = arr[i];
    if (arr[i] === 0 && --j < n) arr[j] = 0;
  }
};
```

```js
/*
Approach: Count the number of zeros that occur. Every number in the original array
is shifted to the right by the number of zeros before it. Because of that cutoff,
we must check if the new position of the number is inside the original array's length.
*/
const duplicateZeros = (arr) => {
  const n = arr.length;
  let numZeros = arr.reduce((acc, cur) => acc + (cur === 0), 0);

  for (let i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    // Would this element be present in the array after the extra 0s are added?
    // If so, it is now shifted to the right by numZeros
    if (i + numZeros < n) arr[i + numZeros] = arr[i];

    // When we encounter a 0 it must be duplicated.
    if (arr[i] === 0) {
      // There is now 1 less zero the remaining elements need to make room for
      numZeros--;

      // Again, check if this element would be present (in bounds of input array's length)
      // after being shifted to the right by numZeros
      // If so, set that shifted index to 0, thereby duplicating this element
      if (i + numZeros < n) arr[i + numZeros] = 0;
    }
  }
};
```
