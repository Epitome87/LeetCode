# [27. Remove Element](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-element)

## Description

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `val`, remove all occurrences of `val` in `nums` [**in-place**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm). The order of the elements may be changed. Then return _the number of elements in_ `nums` _which are not equal to_ `val`.

Consider the number of elements in `nums` which are not equal to `val` be `k`, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:

- Change the array `nums` such that the first `k` elements of `nums` contain the elements which are not equal to `val`. The remaining elements of `nums` are not important as well as the size of `nums`.
- Return `k`.

**Custom Judge:**

The judge will test your solution with the following code:

```
int\[\] nums = [...];           // Input array
int val = ...;                  // Value to remove
int\[\] expectedNums = [...];   // The expected answer with correct length.
                                // It is sorted with no values equaling val.

int k = removeElement(nums, val);// Calls your implementation

assert k == expectedNums.length;
sort(nums, 0, k);               // Sort the first k elements of nums
for (int i = 0; i < actualLength; i++) {
    assert nums\[i\] == expectedNums[i];
}
```

If all assertions pass, then your solution will be **accepted**.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[3,2,2,3\], val = 3  
**Output:** 2, nums = \[2,2,\_,\_\]  
**Explanation:** Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 2.  
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2\], val = 2  
**Output:** 5, nums = \[0,1,4,0,3,\_,\_,\_\]  
**Explanation:** Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums containing 0, 0, 1, 3, and 4.  
Note that the five elements can be returned in any order.  
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

**Constraints:**

- `0 <= nums.length <= 100`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 50`
- `0 <= val <= 100`

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
/*
Approach: Keep track of a current index indicating where the next non-val
number should be placed. Any time we encounter a non-val num, we place that value
at the current index and then increment it by 1.
*/
const removeElement = (nums, val) => {
  // We increment this counter every time we come across an item we want to keep
  let count = 0;

  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    // Only increment our counter if the element is not val
    if (nums[i] !== val) {
      nums[count] = nums[i];
      count++;
    }
  }

  return count;
};
```

```js
/*
Approach: Two Pointer. We swap all unwanted values to the end of the array.
We then decrement the end pointer, so unwanted elements trickle to the right while
wanted elements trickle to the left.
*/
const removeElement = (nums, val) => {
  let result = 0;
  let left = 0;
  let right = nums.length - 1;

  while (left <= right) {
    if (nums[left] === val) {
      // Swap left and right numbers. This moves unwanted values to the end
      [nums[left], nums[right]] = [nums[right], nums[left]];
      right--;
    } else {
      result++;
      left++;
    }
  }

  return result;
};
```

**Python**

```py
def removeElement(nums: List[int], val: int) -> int:
    count = 0

    for n in nums:
        if n != val:
            nums[count] = n
            count += 1

    return count
```
