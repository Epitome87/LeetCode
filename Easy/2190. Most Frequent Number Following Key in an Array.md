# [2190. Most Frequent Number Following Key in an Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/most-frequent-number-following-key-in-an-array)

## Description

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums`. You are also given an integer `key`, which is present in `nums`.

For every unique integer `target` in `nums`, **count** the number of times `target` immediately follows an occurrence of `key` in `nums`. In other words, count the number of indices `i` such that:

- `0 <= i <= nums.length - 2`,
- `nums[i] == key` and,
- `nums[i + 1] == target`.

Return _the_ `target` _with the **maximum** count_. The test cases will be generated such that the `target` with maximum count is unique.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [1,100,200,1,100], key = 1  
**Output:** 100  
**Explanation:** For target = 100, there are 2 occurrences at indices 1 and 4 which follow an occurrence of key.  
No other integers follow an occurrence of key, so we return 100.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [2,2,2,2,3], key = 2  
**Output:** 2  
**Explanation:** For target = 2, there are 3 occurrences at indices 1, 2, and 3 which follow an occurrence of key.  
For target = 3, there is only one occurrence at index 4 which follows an occurrence of key.  
target = 2 has the maximum number of occurrences following an occurrence of key, so we return 2.

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= nums.length <= 1000`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 1000`
- The test cases will be generated such that the answer is unique.

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
const mostFrequent = (nums, key) => {
  let result = 0;
  let frequency = Array(1001).fill(0);

  for (let i = 1; i < nums.length; ++i) {
    if (nums[i - 1] === key && ++frequency[nums[i]] > frequency[result]) {
      result = nums[i];
    }
  }

  return result;
};
```

| Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
| --------------- | ---------------- |
| O(N)            | O(1)             |

```js
const mostFrequent = (nums, key) => {
  let result = null;
  let maximumCount = 0;
  const frequency = {};

  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length - 1; ++i) {
    if (nums[i] === key) {
      frequency[nums[i + 1]] = frequency[nums[i + 1]] + 1 || 1;
    }
  }

  for (let [key, val] of Object.entries(frequency)) {
    if (val > maximumCount) {
      maximumCount = val;
      result = +key;
    }
  }

  return result;
};
```
