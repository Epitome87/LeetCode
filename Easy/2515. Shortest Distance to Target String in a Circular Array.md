# [2515. Shortest Distance to Target String in a Circular Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-distance-to-target-string-in-a-circular-array)

## Description

You are given a **0-indexed** **circular** string array `words` and a string `target`. A **circular array** means that the array's end connects to the array's beginning.

- Formally, the next element of `words[i]` is `words[(i + 1) % n]` and the previous element of `words[i]` is `words[(i - 1 + n) % n]`, where `n` is the length of `words`.

Starting from `startIndex`, you can move to either the next word or the previous word with `1` step at a time.

Return _the **shortest** distance needed to reach the string_ `target`. If the string `target` does not exist in `words`, return `-1`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** words = ["hello","i","am","leetcode","hello"], target = "hello", startIndex = 1  
**Output:** 1  
**Explanation:** We start from index 1 and can reach "hello" by

- moving 3 units to the right to reach index 4.
- moving 2 units to the left to reach index 4.
- moving 4 units to the right to reach index 0.
- moving 1 unit to the left to reach index 0.

The shortest distance to reach "hello" is 1.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** words = ["a","b","leetcode"], target = "leetcode", startIndex = 0  
**Output:** 1  
**Explanation:** We start from index 0 and can reach "leetcode" by

- moving 2 units to the right to reach index 3.
- moving 1 unit to the left to reach index 3.

The shortest distance to reach "leetcode" is 1.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** words = ["i","eat","leetcode"], target = "ate", startIndex = 0  
**Output:** -1  
**Explanation:** Since "ate" does not exist in `words`, we return -1.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= words.length <= 100`
- `1 <= words[i].length <= 100`
- `words[i]` and `target` consist of only lowercase English letters.
- `0 <= startIndex < words.length`

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
const closestTarget = (words, target, startIndex) => {
  let result = Infinity;

  for (let i = 0; i < words.length; ++i) {
    if (words[i] === target) {
      const rightDistance = Math.abs(i - startIndex);
      const leftDistance = words.length - rightDistance;
      result = Math.min(result, leftDistance, rightDistance);
    }
  }

  return result === Infinity ? -1 : result;
};
```
