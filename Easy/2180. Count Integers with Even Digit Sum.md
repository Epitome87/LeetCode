# [2180. Count Integers with Even Digit Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-integers-with-even-digit-sum)

## Description

Given a positive integer `num`, return _the number of positive integers **less than or equal to**_ `num` _whose digit sums are **even**_.

The **digit sum** of a positive integer is the sum of all its digits.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** num = 4  
**Output:** 2  
**Explanation:**  
The only integers less than or equal to 4 whose digit sums are even are 2 and 4.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** num = 30  
**Output:** 14  
**Explanation:**  
The 14 integers less than or equal to 30 whose digit sums are even are  
2, 4, 6, 8, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 20, 22, 24, 26, and 28.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= num <= 1000`

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
/*
Approach: Simply count the digit sum of the original input num and check that parity.
An even parity means there will be num / 2 numbers from [1, n] that are even parity.
An odd parity means there will be (n - 1) // 2 numbers from [1, n] that are even parity.
Examples: 14 => 1 + 5 => 5 => Odd parity => Len([2, 4, 6, 8, 11, 13]) => 6 => (num - 1) // 2
22 => 2 + 2 => 4 => Even parity => Len([2, 4, 6, 8, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 20, 22]) => 11 => num / 2
This works because we can observe that from 1-10 we have 4 even sums, 11-20 we have 6 even sums,
21-30 we have 4 even sums again, 31-40 we have 6 even sums again, etc.
So we observe that every new tens digit changes our result. BUT we can also observe that whether we are 
on 9 or 10 we get an odd sum, whether we are on 19 or 20 we get an even sum, etc. So these edge cases
where we are going from one tens digit to the next are handled by (n - 1) // 2 and n // 2, respectively

const countEven = (num) => {
  const n = num;
  let sum = 0;

  while (num) {
    sum += num % 10;
    num = Math.floor(num / 10);
  }

  if (sum % 2) return Math.floor((n - 1) / 2);
  else return Math.floor(n / 2);
};
```

| O(Log(N))       | O(1)             |

```js
// Approach: Brute-Force
const countEven = (num) => {
  let result = 0;

  for (let i = 1; i <= num; ++i) {
    result += digitSum(i) % 2 === 0;
  }

  return result;
};

const digitSum = (n) => {
  let result = 0;

  while (n) {
    const digit = n % 10;
    result += digit;
    n = Math.floor(n / 10);
  }

  return result;
};
```
