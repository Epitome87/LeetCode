# [860. Lemonade Change](https://leetcode.com/problems/lemonade-change)

## Description

At a lemonade stand, each lemonade costs `$5`. Customers are standing in a queue to buy from you and order one at a time (in the order specified by bills). Each customer will only buy one lemonade and pay with either a `$5`, `$10`, or `$20` bill. You must provide the correct change to each customer so that the net transaction is that the customer pays `$5`.

Note that you do not have any change in hand at first.

Given an integer array `bills` where `bills[i]` is the bill the `ith` customer pays, return `true` _if you can provide every customer with the correct change, or_ `false` _otherwise_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** bills = \[5,5,5,10,20\]  
**Output:** true  
**Explanation:**  
From the first 3 customers, we collect three $5 bills in order.  
From the fourth customer, we collect a $10 bill and give back a $5.  
From the fifth customer, we give a $10 bill and a $5 bill.  
Since all customers got correct change, we output true.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** bills = \[5,5,10,10,20\]  
**Output:** false  
**Explanation:**  
From the first two customers in order, we collect two $5 bills.  
For the next two customers in order, we collect a $10 bill and give back a $5 bill.  
For the last customer, we can not give the change of $15 back because we only have two $10 bills.  
Since not every customer received the correct change, the answer is false.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= bills.length <= 10^5`
- `bills[i]` is either `5`, `10`, or `20`.

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
const lemonadeChange = function (bills) {
  const change = { 5: 0, 10: 0, 20: 0 };

  for (let bill of bills) {
    if (bill === 5) change[5]++;
    else if (bill === 10) {
      change[10]++;
      change[5]--;
    } else if (bill === 20) {
      change[20]++;
      // Prefer giving back 10's over 5's
      if (change[10] > 0) {
        change[10]--;
        change[5]--;
      } else change[5] -= 3;
    }

    if (change[5] < 0) return false;
  }

  return true;
};
```

**Python**

```py
def lemonadeChange(bills: List[int]) -> bool:
    five = ten = 0

    for bill in bills:
        if bill == 5: five += 1     # No change required - just take the 5
        elif bill == 10:
            ten += 1                # Take their 10, return a 5
            five -= 1
        elif ten > 0:               # Take their 20 (don't track) and...
            ten -= 1                # Return a ten and a five if we have a ten
            five -= 1
        else: five -= 3             # Otherwise return 3 fives

        # If we ran out of five (which we priotized giving),
        # we must have run out of proper change entirely
        if five < 0: return False

    return True
```
