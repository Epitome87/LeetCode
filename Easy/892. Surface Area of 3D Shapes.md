# [892. Surface Area of 3D Shapes](https://leetcode.com/problems/surface-area-of-3d-shapes)

## Description

You are given an `n x n` `grid` where you have placed some `1 x 1 x 1` cubes. Each value `v = grid[i][j]` represents a tower of `v` cubes placed on top of cell `(i, j)`.

After placing these cubes, you have decided to glue any directly adjacent cubes to each other, forming several irregular 3D shapes.

Return _the total surface area of the resulting shapes_.

**Note:** The bottom face of each shape counts toward its surface area.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** grid = \[\[1,2\],\[3,4\]\]  
**Output:** 34

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/08/tmp-grid4.jpg)

**Input:** grid = \[\[1,1,1\],\[1,0,1\],\[1,1,1\]\]  
**Output:** 32

**Example 3:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/08/tmp-grid5.jpg)

**Input:** grid = \[\[2,2,2\],\[2,1,2\],\[2,2,2\]\]  
**Output:** 46

**Constraints:**

- `n == grid.length == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= n <= 50`
- `0 <= grid[i][j] <= 50`

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
/*
For each cube, the surface area is 6 (each side is 1x1, and there are 6 sides).
For each tower of height grid[i][j], the total surface area would be 6 * numCubes - connectedSides.
We can note that for a tower of height H, the connected surface is provided by 2 * (H - 1).
A tower of 2 cubes, for instance, shares 1 common side (2 * (2 - 1) = 2).
A tower of 4 cubes will share 3 sides (2 * (4 - 1) = 6).
For cubes that are adjacent on the x and y axis, the formula is similar for the shared surfaces, but
we need to find the minimum height of the towers for these axes.
Since for each x and y adjacent tower we are only focused on two towers at once, the formula for shared sides
becomes 2 * (2 - 1), i.e just 2. We multiply 2 by the minimum height, as the minimum is how many cubes the two
adjacent towers have connected.

const surfaceArea = (grid) => {
  let result = 0;
  let n = grid.length;

  for (let i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    for (let j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
      // Calculate the number of sides showing on the z axis. We do this for every grid tower.
      if (grid[i][j]) result += 6 * grid[i][j] - 2 * (grid[i][j] - 1);

      // Calculate the number of sides showing on the x axis. Do not do this for first x-axis tower
      if (i) result -= Math.min(grid[i][j], grid[i - 1][j]) * 2;

      // Calculate the number of sides showing on the y axis. Do not do this for first y-axis tower
      if (j) result -= Math.min(grid[i][j], grid[i][j - 1]) * 2;
    }
  }

  return result;
};
```
