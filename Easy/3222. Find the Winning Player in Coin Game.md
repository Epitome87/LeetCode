# [3222. Find the Winning Player in Coin Game](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-winning-player-in-coin-game)

## Description

You are given two **positive** integers `x` and `y`, denoting the number of coins with values 75 and 10 _respectively_.

Alice and Bob are playing a game. Each turn, starting with **Alice**, the player must pick up coins with a **total** value 115. If the player is unable to do so, they **lose** the game.

Return the _name_ of the player who wins the game if both players play **optimally**.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** x = 2, y = 7  
**Output:** "Alice"  
**Explanation:**  
The game ends in a single turn:

- Alice picks 1 coin with a value of 75 and 4 coins with a value of 10.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** x = 4, y = 11  
**Output:** "Bob"  
**Explanation:**  
The game ends in 2 turns:

- Alice picks 1 coin with a value of 75 and 4 coins with a value of 10.
- Bob picks 1 coin with a value of 75 and 4 coins with a value of 10.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= x, y <= 100`

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
/*
A winning hand MUST have one x and 4 y (1 * 75  + 4 * 10).
If we can calculate how many turns the game will last, we can see on whose
turn the game will end on a loss for.
*/
const winningPlayer = (x, y) => {
  // How many complete turns can there be, i.e which coin will run out first?
  const numTurns = Math.min(x, Math.floor(y / 4));

  // An odd amount of turns means Alice (the starting player) will win.
  return numTurns % 2 ? 'Alice' : 'Bob';
};
```

| Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
| --------------- | ---------------- |
| O(1)            | O(1)             |

```js
// Approach: Simulate each round, where players optimally pick
// one 75 coin and four 10 coins to win.
const winningPlayer = (x, y) => {
  let numTurns = 0;

  while (x >= 1 && y >= 4) {
    x--;
    y -= 4;
    numTurns++;
  }

  return numTurns % 2 ? 'Alice' : 'Bob';
};
```

| Time Complexity       | Space Complexity |
| --------------------- | ---------------- |
| O(Log(Min(x, y / 4))) | O(1)             |
