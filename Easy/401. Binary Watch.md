# [401. Binary Watch](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-watch)

## Description

A binary watch has 4 LEDs on the top to represent the hours (0-11), and 6 LEDs on the bottom to represent the minutes (0-59). Each LED represents a zero or one, with the least significant bit on the right.

- For example, the below binary watch reads `"4:51"`.

Given an integer `turnedOn` which represents the number of LEDs that are currently on (ignoring the PM), return _all possible times the watch could represent_. You may return the answer in **any order**.

The hour must not contain a leading zero.

- For example, `"01:00"` is not valid. It should be `"1:00"`.

The minute must consist of two digits and may contain a leading zero.

- For example, `"10:2"` is not valid. It should be `"10:02"`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** turnedOn = 1  
**Output:** \["0:01","0:02","0:04","0:08","0:16","0:32","1:00","2:00","4:00","8:00"\]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** turnedOn = 9  
**Output:** \[\]

**Constraints:**

- `0 <= turnedOn <= 10`

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
// Brute-Force
const readBinaryWatch = (turnedOn) => {
  const result = [];

  for (let h = 0; h < 12; h++) {
    for (let m = 0; m < 60; m++) {
      const binaryHour = h.toString(2);
      const binaryMin = m.toString(2);
      const numOnes = (binaryHour + binaryMin).match(/1/g)?.length || 0;
      if (numOnes === turnedOn) {
        result.push(`${h}:${m < 10 ? `0${m}` : m}`);
      }
    }
  }
  return result;
};
```

**Python**

```py
def readBinaryWatch(self, turnedOn):
    return ['%d:%02d' % (h, m) for h in range(12) for m in range(60) if (bin(h) + bin(m)).count('1') == turnedOn]
```
