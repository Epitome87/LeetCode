# [914. X of a Kind in a Deck of Cards](https://leetcode.com/problems/x-of-a-kind-in-a-deck-of-cards)

## Description

You are given an integer array `deck` where `deck[i]` represents the number written on the `ith` card.

Partition the cards into **one or more groups** such that:

- Each group has **exactly** `x` cards where `x > 1`, and
- All the cards in one group have the same integer written on them.

Return `true` _if such partition is possible, or_ `false` _otherwise_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** deck = \[1,2,3,4,4,3,2,1\]  
**Output:** true  
**Explanation**: Possible partition \[1,1\],\[2,2\],\[3,3\],\[4,4\].

**Example 2:**

**Input:** deck = \[1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3\]  
**Output:** false  
**Explanation**: No possible partition.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= deck.length <= 10^4`
- `0 <= deck[i] < 10^4`

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
/*
Approach: Count the frequency of each number.
Check if the greatest common divisor of the counts is greater than 1.
This is because we want to group each number's frequency into equal size groups (gcd)
*/
const hasGroupsSizeX = (deck) => {
  let result = 0;
  const counts = deck.reduce((acc, cur) => ((acc[cur] = acc[cur] + 1 || 1), acc), {});

  for (let key in counts) {
    result = gcd(result, counts[key]);
  }

  return result >= 2;
};

const gcd = (a, b) => (b === 0 ? a : gcd(b, a % b));
```
