# [3467. Transform Array by Parity](https://leetcode.com/problems/transform-array-by-parity)

## Description

You are given an integer array `nums`. Transform `nums` by performing the following operations in the **exact** order specified:

1.  Replace each even number with 0.
2.  Replace each odd numbers with 1.
3.  Sort the modified array in **non-decreasing** order.

Return the resulting array after performing these operations.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[4,3,2,1\]  
**Output:** \[0,0,1,1\]  
**Explanation:**

- Replace the even numbers (4 and 2) with 0 and the odd numbers (3 and 1) with 1. Now, `nums = [0, 1, 0, 1]`.
- After sorting `nums` in non-descending order, `nums = [0, 0, 1, 1]`.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,5,1,4,2\]  
**Output:** \[0,0,1,1,1\]  
**Explanation:**

- Replace the even numbers (4 and 2) with 0 and the odd numbers (1, 5 and 1) with 1. Now, `nums = [1, 1, 1, 0, 0]`.
- After sorting `nums` in non-descending order, `nums = [0, 0, 1, 1, 1]`.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 1000`

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
/*
Approach: Observe that every odd number becomes a 1 and every even becomes a 0.
When sorting in ascending, we will sort only between 0's and 1's. Therefore, all
even numbers (now 0's) show up at the start of the array, followed by all odd numbers (now 1's).
For this reason, we can simply iterate through the array, changing each value to 1 and -- if even --
we change the number at an incrementing index tracker to 0. This index represents the index of the next
even (0) number.
*/
const transformArray = (nums) => {
  // Track where to place our next 0
  let indexSorted = 0;

  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; ++i) {
    if (nums[i] % 2) {
      // Odd numbers become 1
      nums[i] = 1;
    } else {
      // Even numbers become 0. All evens appear first, which is why we make use of indexSorted.
      // Remember, indexSorted is where we place evens (0's). Set nums[i] to 1 for everything else.
      nums[i] = 1;
      nums[indexSorted++] = 0;
    }
  }

  return nums;
};
```

| Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
| --------------- | ---------------- |
| O(N)            | O(1)             |

```js
// Approach: Return an array with an appropriate amount of 0's followed by 1's
const transformArray = (nums) => {
  const numOdd = nums.reduce((acc, cur) => acc + (cur % 2), 0);
  const numEven = nums.length - numOdd;
  return [...new Array(numEven).fill(0), ...new Array(numOdd).fill(1)];
};
```

| Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
| --------------- | ---------------- |
| O(N)            | O(N)             |

```js
// Approach: Just follow each step literally
const transformArray = (nums) => {
  let numsCopy = [...nums];

  // Replace each even number with 0
  numsCopy = numsCopy.map((n) => (n % 2 ? n : 0));

  // Replace each odd number with 1
  numsCopy = numsCopy.map((n) => (n % 2 ? 1 : n));

  // Sort in non-decreasing
  numsCopy.sort((a, b) => a - b);

  return numsCopy;
};
```

| Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
| --------------- | ---------------- |
| O(N \* Log(N))  | O(N)             |
