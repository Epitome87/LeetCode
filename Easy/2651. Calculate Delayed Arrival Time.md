# [2651. Calculate Delayed Arrival Time](https://leetcode.com/problems/calculate-delayed-arrival-time)

## Description

You are given a positive integer `arrivalTime` denoting the arrival time of a train in hours, and another positive integer `delayedTime` denoting the amount of delay in hours.

Return _the time when the train will arrive at the station._

Note that the time in this problem is in 24-hours format.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** arrivalTime = 15, delayedTime = 5  
**Output:** 20  
**Explanation:** Arrival time of the train was 15:00 hours. It is delayed by 5 hours. Now it will reach at 15+5 = 20 (20:00 hours).

**Example 2:**

**Input:** arrivalTime = 13, delayedTime = 11  
**Output:** 0  
**Explanation:** Arrival time of the train was 13:00 hours. It is delayed by 11 hours. Now it will reach at 13+11=24 (Which is denoted by 00:00 in 24 hours format so return 0).

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= arrivaltime < 24`
- `1 <= delayedTime <= 24`

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
const findDelayedArrivalTime = (arrivalTime, delayedTime) => (arrivalTime + delayedTime) % 24;
```

| Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
| --------------- | ---------------- |
| O(1)            | O(1)             |

**Python**

```python
def findDelayedArrivalTime(self, arrivalTime: int, delayedTime: int) -> int:
    return (arrivalTime + delayedTime) % 24
```

| Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
| --------------- | ---------------- |
| O(1)            | O(1)             |
