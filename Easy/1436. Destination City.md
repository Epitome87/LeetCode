# [1436. Destination City](https://leetcode.com/problems/destination-city)

## Description

You are given the array `paths`, where `paths[i] = [cityAi, cityBi]` means there exists a direct path going from `cityAi` to `cityBi`. _Return the destination city, that is, the city without any path outgoing to another city._

It is guaranteed that the graph of paths forms a line without any loop, therefore, there will be exactly one destination city.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** paths = [["London","New York"],["New York","Lima"],["Lima","Sao Paulo"]]  
**Output:** "Sao Paulo"  
**Explanation:** Starting at "London" city you will reach "Sao Paulo" city which is the destination city. Your trip consist of: "London" -> "New York" -> "Lima" -> "Sao Paulo".

**Example 2:**

**Input:** paths = [["B","C"],["D","B"],["C","A"]]  
**Output:** "A"  
**Explanation:** All possible trips are:   
"D" -> "B" -> "C" -> "A". 
"B" -> "C" -> "A". 
"C" -> "A". 
"A". 
Clearly the destination city is "A".

**Example 3:**

**Input:** paths = [["A","Z"]]
**Output:** "Z"

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= paths.length <= 100`
- `paths[i].length == 2`
- `1 <= cityAi.length, cityBi.length <= 10`
- `cityAi != cityBi`
- All strings consist of lowercase and uppercase English letters and the space character.

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
// Approach: Using a single Set
// Find which city occurs as a cityB but not a cityA
const destCity = (paths) => {
  const pathSet = new Set();

  for (let path of paths) pathSet.add(path[1]);
  for (let path of paths) pathSet.delete(path[0]);

  return pathSet.values().next().value;
};
```

| --------------- | ---------------- |
| O(N)            | O(N)             |

```js
// Approach: Brute-Force by finding if the current city leads to another (is in cityA array)
const destCity = (paths) => {
  const cityA = paths.map((v) => v[0]);
  const cityB = paths.map((v) => v[1]);
  let city = cityB[0];

  for (let i = 0; i < paths.length; ++i) {
    const index = cityA.indexOf(city);
    if (index !== -1) city = cityB[index];
    else return city;
  }
};
```
